See the License for the\\nspecific language governing permissions and limitations\\nunder the License.\\n--\x3e\\n\\nApparently hot-cold data separation is hot now. But first of all:\\n\\n## What is Hot/Cold Data?\\n\\nIn simple terms, hot data is the frequently accessed data, while cold data is the one you seldom visit but still need. Normally in data analytics, data is \\"hot\\" when it is new, and gets \\"colder\\" and \\"colder\\" as time goes by. \\n\\nFor example, orders of the past six months are \\"hot\\" and logs from years ago are \\"cold\\". But no matter how cold the logs are, you still need them to be somewhere you can find.  \\n\\n## Why Separate Hot and Cold Data? \\n\\nHot-Cold Data Separation is an idea often seen in real life: You put your favorite book on your bedside table, your Christmas ornament in the attic, and your childhood art project in the garage or a cheap self-storage space on the other side of town. The purpose is a tidy and efficient life.\\n\\nSimilarly, companies separate hot and cold data for more efficient computation and more cost-effective storage, because storage that allows quick read/write is always expensive, like SSD. On the other hand, HDD is cheaper but slower. So it is more sensible to put hot data on SSD and cold data on HDD. If you are looking for an even lower-cost option, you can go for object storage.\\n\\nIn data analytics, hot-cold data separation is implemented by a tiered storage mechanism in the database. For example, Apache Doris supports three-tiered storage: SSD, HDD, and object storage. For newly ingested data, after a specified cooldown period, it will turn from hot data into cold data and be moved to object storage. In addition, object storage only preserves one copy of data, which further cuts down storage costs and the relevant computation/network overheads.\\n\\n![](../static/images/HCDS_1.png)\\n\\nHow much can you save by hot-cold data separation? Here is some math.\\n\\nIn public cloud services, cloud disks generally cost 5~10 times as much as object storage. If 80% of your data asset is cold data and you put it in object storage instead of cloud disks, you can expect a cost reduction of around 70%.\\n\\nLet the percentage of cold data be \\"rate\\", the price of object storage be \\"OS\\", and the price of cloud disk be \\"CloudDisk\\", this is how much you can save by hot-cold data separation instead of putting all your data on cloud disks: \\n\\n![](../static/images/HCDS_2.png)\\n\\nNow let\'s put real-world numbers in this formula: \\n\\nAWS pricing, US East (Ohio):\\n\\n- **S3 Standard Storage**: 23 USD per TB per month\\n- **Throughput Optimized HDD (st 1)**: 102 USD per TB per month\\n- **General Purpose SSD (gp2)**: 158 USD per TB per month\\n\\n![](../static/images/HCDS_3.png)\\n\\n## How Is Hot-Cold Separation Implemented?\\n\\nTill now, hot-cold separation sounds nice, but the biggest concern is: how can we implement it without compromising query performance? This can be broken down to three questions:\\n\\n- How to enable quick reading of cold data?\\n- How to ensure high availability of data?\\n- How to reduce I/O and CPU overheads?\\n\\nIn what follows, I will show you how Apache Doris addresses them one by one.\\n\\n### Quick Reading of Cold Data\\n\\nAccessing cold data from object storage will indeed be slow. One solution is to cache cold data in local disks for use in queries. In Apache Doris 2.0, when a query requests cold data, only the first-time access will entail a full network I/O operation from object storage. Subsequent queries will be able to read data directly from local cache.\\n\\nThe granularity of caching matters, too. A coarse granularity might lead to a waste of cache space, but a fine granularity could be the reason for low I/O efficiency. Apache Doris bases its caching on data blocks. It downloads cold data blocks from object storage onto local Block Cache. This is the \\"pre-heating\\" process. With cold data fully pre-heated, queries on tables with hot-cold data separation will be basically as fast as those on tablets without. We drew this conclusion from test results on Apache Doris:\\n\\n![](../static/images/HCDS_4.png)\\n\\n- ***Test Data****: SSB SF100 dataset*\\n- ***Configuration****: 3 \xd7 16C 64G, a cluster of 1 frontend and 3 backends* \\n\\nP.S. Block Cache adopts the LRU algorithm, so the more frequently accessed data will stay in Block Cache for longer.\\n\\n### High Availability of Data\\n\\nIn object storage, only one copy of cold data is preserved. Within Apache Doris, hot data and metadata are put in the backend nodes, and there are multiple replicas of them across different backend nodes in order to ensure high data availability. These replicas are called \\"local replicas\\". The metadata of cold data is synchronized to all local replicas, so that Doris can ensure high availability of cold data without using too much storage space.\\n\\nImplementation-wise, the Doris frontend picks a local replica as the Leader. Updates to the Leader will be synchronized to all other local replicas via a regular report mechanism. Also, as the Leader uploads data to object storage, the relevant metadata will be updated to other local replicas, too.\\n\\n![](../static/images/HCDS_5.png)\\n\\n### Reduced I/O and CPU Overhead\\n\\nThis is realized by cold data [compaction](https://medium.com/gitconnected/understanding-data-compaction-in-3-minutes-d2b5a1f7446f). Some scenarios require large-scale update of historical data. In this case, part of the cold data in object storage should be deleted. Apache Doris 2.0 supports cold data compaction, which ensures that the updated cold data will be reorganized and compacted, so that it will take up storage space.\\n\\nA thread in Doris backend will regularly pick N tablets from the cold data and start compaction. Every tablet has a CooldownReplica and only the CooldownReplica will execute cold data compaction for the tablet. Every time 5MB of data is compacted, it will be uploaded to object storage to clear up space locally. Once the compaction is done, the CooldownReplica will update the new metadata to object storage. Other replicas only need to synchronize the metadata from object storage. This is how I/O and CPU overheads are reduced.\\n\\n## Tutorial\\n\\nSeparating hot and cold data in storage is a huge cost saver and there have been ways to ensure the same fast query performance. Executing hot-cold data separation is a simple 6-step process, so you can find out how it works yourself:\\n\\n\\n\\nTo begin with, you need **an object storage bucket** and the relevant **Access Key (AK)** and **Secret Access Key (SK)**.\\n\\nThen you can start cold/hot data separation by following these six steps.\\n\\n### 1. Create Resource\\n\\nYou can create a resource using the object storage bucket with the AK and  SK. Apache Doris supports object storage on various cloud service  providers including AWS, Azure, and Alibaba Cloud.\\n\\n```\\nCREATE RESOURCE IF NOT EXISTS \\"${resource_name}\\"\\n        PROPERTIES(\\n            \\"type\\"=\\"s3\\",\\n            \\"s3.endpoint\\" = \\"${S3Endpoint}\\",\\n            \\"s3.region\\" = \\"${S3Region}\\",\\n            \\"s3.root.path\\" = \\"path/to/root\\",\\n            \\"s3.access_key\\" = \\"${S3AK}\\",\\n            \\"s3.secret_key\\" = \\"${S3SK}\\",\\n            \\"s3.connection.maximum\\" = \\"50\\",\\n            \\"s3.connection.request.timeout\\" = \\"3000\\",\\n            \\"s3.connection.timeout\\" = \\"1000\\",\\n            \\"s3.bucket\\" = \\"${S3BucketName}\\"\\n        );\\n```\\n\\n###  2. Create Storage Policy\\n\\nWith the Storage Policy, you can specify the cooling-down period of data  (including absolute cooling-down period and relative cooling-down  period).\\n\\n```\\nCREATE STORAGE POLICY testPolicy\\nPROPERTIES(\\n  \\"storage_resource\\" = \\"remote_s3\\",\\n  \\"cooldown_ttl\\" = \\"1d\\"\\n);\\n```\\n\\nIn the above snippet, the Storage Policy is named `testPolicy`, and data will start to cool down one day after it is ingested. The cold data will be moved under the `root path` of the object storage `remote_s3`. Apart from setting the TTL, you can also specify the timepoint when the cooling down starts.\\n\\n```\\nCREATE STORAGE POLICY testPolicyForTTlDatatime\\nPROPERTIES(\\n  \\"storage_resource\\" = \\"remote_s3\\",\\n  \\"cooldown_datetime\\" = \\"2023-06-07 21:00:00\\"\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Specify Storage Policy for a Table/Partition\\n\\nWith an established Resource and a Storage Policy, you can set a Storage Policy for a data table or a specific data partition.\\n\\nThe following snippet uses the lineitem table in the TPC-H dataset as an  example. To set a Storage Policy for the whole table, specify the  PROPERTIES as follows:\\n\\n```\\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lineitem1 (\\n            L_ORDERKEY    INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n            L_PARTKEY     INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n            L_SUPPKEY     INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n            L_LINENUMBER  INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n            L_QUANTITY    DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,\\n            L_EXTENDEDPRICE  DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,\\n            L_DISCOUNT    DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,\\n            L_TAX         DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,\\n            L_RETURNFLAG  CHAR(1) NOT NULL,\\n            L_LINESTATUS  CHAR(1) NOT NULL,\\n            L_SHIPDATE    DATEV2 NOT NULL,\\n            L_COMMITDATE  DATEV2 NOT NULL,\\n            L_RECEIPTDATE DATEV2 NOT NULL,\\n            L_SHIPINSTRUCT CHAR(25) NOT NULL,\\n            L_SHIPMODE     CHAR(10) NOT NULL,\\n            L_COMMENT      VARCHAR(44) NOT NULL\\n            )\\n            DUPLICATE KEY(L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER)\\n            PARTITION BY RANGE(`L_SHIPDATE`)\\n            (\\n                PARTITION `p202301` VALUES LESS THAN (\\"2017-02-01\\"),\\n                PARTITION `p202302` VALUES LESS THAN (\\"2017-03-01\\")\\n            )\\n            DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(L_ORDERKEY) BUCKETS 3\\n            PROPERTIES (\\n            \\"replication_num\\" = \\"3\\",\\n            \\"storage_policy\\" = \\"${policy_name}\\"\\n            )\\n```\\n\\nYou can check the Storage Policy of a tablet via the `show tablets` command. If the `CooldownReplicaId` is anything rather than `-1` and the `CooldownMetaId` is not null, that means the current tablet has been specified with a Storage Policy.\\n\\n```\\n               TabletId: 3674797\\n              ReplicaId: 3674799\\n              BackendId: 10162\\n             SchemaHash: 513232100\\n                Version: 1\\n      LstSuccessVersion: 1\\n       LstFailedVersion: -1\\n          LstFailedTime: NULL\\n          LocalDataSize: 0\\n         RemoteDataSize: 0\\n               RowCount: 0\\n                  State: NORMAL\\nLstConsistencyCheckTime: NULL\\n           CheckVersion: -1\\n           VersionCount: 1\\n              QueryHits: 0\\n               PathHash: 8030511811695924097\\n                MetaUrl: http://172.16.0.16:6781/api/meta/header/3674797\\n       CompactionStatus: http://172.16.0.16:6781/api/compaction/show?tablet_id=3674797\\n      CooldownReplicaId: 3674799\\n         CooldownMetaId: TUniqueId(hi:-8987737979209762207, lo:-2847426088899160152)\\n```\\n\\nTo set a Storage Policy for a specific partition, add the policy name to the partition PROPERTIES as follows:\\n\\n```\\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lineitem1 (\\n            L_ORDERKEY    INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n            L_PARTKEY     INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n            L_SUPPKEY     INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n            L_LINENUMBER  INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n            L_QUANTITY    DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,\\n            L_EXTENDEDPRICE  DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,\\n            L_DISCOUNT    DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,\\n            L_TAX         DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,\\n            L_RETURNFLAG  CHAR(1) NOT NULL,\\n            L_LINESTATUS  CHAR(1) NOT NULL,\\n            L_SHIPDATE    DATEV2 NOT NULL,\\n            L_COMMITDATE  DATEV2 NOT NULL,\\n            L_RECEIPTDATE DATEV2 NOT NULL,\\n            L_SHIPINSTRUCT CHAR(25) NOT NULL,\\n            L_SHIPMODE     CHAR(10) NOT NULL,\\n            L_COMMENT      VARCHAR(44) NOT NULL\\n            )\\n            DUPLICATE KEY(L_ORDERKEY, L_PARTKEY, L_SUPPKEY, L_LINENUMBER)\\n            PARTITION BY RANGE(`L_SHIPDATE`)\\n            (\\n                PARTITION `p202301` VALUES LESS THAN (\\"2017-02-01\\") (\\"storage_policy\\" = \\"${policy_name}\\"),\\n                PARTITION `p202302` VALUES LESS THAN (\\"2017-03-01\\")\\n            )\\n            DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(L_ORDERKEY) BUCKETS 3\\n            PROPERTIES (\\n            \\"replication_num\\" = \\"3\\"\\n            )\\n```\\n\\n**This is how you can confirm that only the target partition is set with a Storage Policy:**\\n\\nIn the above example, Table Lineitem1 has 2 partitions, each partition has 3 buckets, and `replication_num` is set to \\"3\\". That means there are 2*3 = 6 tablets and 6*3 = 18 replicas in total.\\n\\nNow, if you check the replica information of all tablets via the `show tablets` command, you will see that only the replicas of tablets of the target  partion have a CooldownReplicaId and a CooldownMetaId. (For a clear  comparison, you can check replica information of a specific partition  via the `ADMIN SHOW REPLICA STATUS FROM TABLE PARTITION(PARTITION)` command.)\\n\\nFor instance, Tablet 3691990 belongs to Partition p202301, which is the  target partition, so the 3 replicas of this tablet have a  CooldownReplicaId and a CooldownMetaId:\\n\\n```\\n*****************************************************************\\n               TabletId: 3691990\\n              ReplicaId: 3691991\\n      CooldownReplicaId: 3691993\\n         CooldownMetaId: TUniqueId(hi:-7401335798601697108, lo:3253711199097733258)\\n*****************************************************************\\n               TabletId: 3691990\\n              ReplicaId: 3691992\\n      CooldownReplicaId: 3691993\\n         CooldownMetaId: TUniqueId(hi:-7401335798601697108, lo:3253711199097733258)\\n*****************************************************************\\n               TabletId: 3691990\\n              ReplicaId: 3691993\\n      CooldownReplicaId: 3691993\\n         CooldownMetaId: TUniqueId(hi:-7401335798601697108, lo:3253711199097733258)\\n```\\n\\nAlso, the above snippet means that all these 3 replicas have been specified  with the same CooldownReplica: 3691993, so only the data in Replica  3691993 will be stored in the Resource.\\n\\n### 4. View Tablet Details\\n\\nYou can view the detailed information of Table Lineitem1 via a `show tablets from lineitem1` command. Among all the properties, `LocalDataSize` represents the size of locally stored data and `RemoteDataSize` represents the size of cold data in object storage.\\n\\nFor example, when the data is newly ingested into the Doris backends, you can see that all data is stored locally.\\n\\n```\\n*************************** 1. row ***************************\\n               TabletId: 2749703\\n              ReplicaId: 2749704\\n              BackendId: 10090\\n             SchemaHash: 1159194262\\n                Version: 3\\n      LstSuccessVersion: 3\\n       LstFailedVersion: -1\\n          LstFailedTime: NULL\\n          LocalDataSize: 73001235\\n         RemoteDataSize: 0\\n               RowCount: 1996567\\n                  State: NORMAL\\nLstConsistencyCheckTime: NULL\\n           CheckVersion: -1\\n           VersionCount: 3\\n              QueryHits: 0\\n               PathHash: -8567514893400420464\\n                MetaUrl: http://172.16.0.8:6781/api/meta/header/2749703\\n       CompactionStatus: http://172.16.0.8:6781/api/compaction/show?tablet_id=2749703\\n      CooldownReplicaId: 2749704\\n         CooldownMetaId:\\n```\\n\\nWhen the data has cooled down, you will see that the data has been moved to remote object storage.\\n\\n```\\n*************************** 1. row ***************************\\n               TabletId: 2749703\\n              ReplicaId: 2749704\\n              BackendId: 10090\\n             SchemaHash: 1159194262\\n                Version: 3\\n      LstSuccessVersion: 3\\n       LstFailedVersion: -1\\n          LstFailedTime: NULL\\n          LocalDataSize: 0\\n         RemoteDataSize: 73001235\\n               RowCount: 1996567\\n                  State: NORMAL\\nLstConsistencyCheckTime: NULL\\n           CheckVersion: -1\\n           VersionCount: 3\\n              QueryHits: 0\\n               PathHash: -8567514893400420464\\n                MetaUrl: http://172.16.0.8:6781/api/meta/header/2749703\\n       CompactionStatus: http://172.16.0.8:6781/api/compaction/show?tablet_id=2749703\\n      CooldownReplicaId: 2749704\\n         CooldownMetaId: TUniqueId(hi:-8697097432131255833, lo:9213158865768502666)\\n```\\n\\nYou can also check your cold data from the object storage side by finding  the data files under the path specified in the Storage Policy.\\n\\nData in object storage only has a single copy.\\n\\n![img](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*jao2TrbhDI2h6S04W0x95Q.png)\\n\\n### 5. Execute Queries\\n\\nWhen all data in Table Lineitem1 has been moved to object storage and a  query requests data from Table Lineitem1, Apache Doris will follow the  root path specified in the Storage Policy of the relevant data  partition, and download the requested data for local computation.\\n\\nApache Doris 2.0 has been optimized for cold data queries. Only the first-time access to the cold data will entail a full network I/O operation from  object storage. After that, the downloaded data will be put in cache to  be available for subsequent queries, so as to improve query speed.\\n\\n### 6. Update Cold Data\\n\\nIn Apache Doris, each data ingestion leads to the generation of a new  Rowset, so the update of historical data will be put in a Rowset that is separated from those of newly loaded data. That\u2019s how it makes sure the updating of cold data does not interfere with the ingestion of hot  data. Once the rowsets cool down, they will be moved to S3 and deleted  locally, and the updated historical data will go to the partition where  it belongs.\\n\\nIf you any questions, come find Apache Doris developers on [Slack](https://t.co/ZxJuNJHXb2).

It is an effective memory allocation and monitoring mechanism. It is how you speed up computation, avoid memory hotspots, promptly respond to insufficient memory, and minimize OOM errors. \\n\\n![](../static/images/OOM_1.png)\\n\\nFrom a database user\'s perspective, how do they suffer from bad memory management? This is a list of things that used to bother our users:\\n\\n- OOM errors cause backend processes to crash. To quote one of our community members: Hi, Apache Doris, it\'s okay to slow things down or fail a few tasks when you are short of memory, but throwing a downtime is just not cool.\\n- Backend processes consume too much memory space, but there is no way to find the exact task to blame or limit the memory usage for a single query.\\n- It is hard to set a proper memory size for each query, so chances are that a query gets canceled even when there is plenty of memory space.\\n- High-concurrency queries are disproportionately slow, and memory hotspots are hard to locate.\\n- Intermediate data during HashTable creation cannot be flushed to disks, so join queries between two large tables often fail due to OOM. \\n\\nLuckily, those dark days are behind us, because we have improved our memory management mechanism from the bottom up. Now get ready, things are going to be intensive.\\n\\n## Memory Allocation\\n\\nIn Apache Doris, we have a one-and-only interface for memory allocation: **Allocator**. It will make adjustments as it sees appropriate to keep memory usage efficient and under control. Also, MemTrackers are in place to track the allocated or released memory size, and three different data structures are responsible for large memory allocation in operator execution (we will get to them immediately).   \\n\\n![](../static/images/OOM_2.png)\\n\\n### Data Structures in Memory\\n\\nAs different queries have different memory hotspot patterns in execution, Apache Doris provides three different in-memory data structures: **Arena**, **HashTable**, and **PODArray**. They are all under the reign of the Allocator.\\n\\n![](../static/images/OOM_3.png)\\n\\n**1. Arena**\\n\\nThe Arena is a memory pool that maintains a list of chunks, which are to be allocated upon request from the Allocator. The chunks support memory alignment. They exist throughout the lifespan of the Arena, and will be freed up upon destruction (usually when the query is completed). Chunks are mainly used to store the serialized or deserialized data during Shuffle, or the serialized Keys in HashTables.\\n\\nThe initial size of a chunk is 4096 bytes. If the current chunk is smaller than the requested memory, a new chunk will be added to the list. If the current chunk is smaller than 128M, the new chunk will double its size; if it is larger than 128M, the new chunk will, at most, be 128M larger than what is required. The old small chunk will not be allocated for new requests. There is a cursor to mark the dividing line of chunks allocated and those unallocated.\\n\\n**2. HashTable**\\n\\nHashTables are applicable for Hash Joins, aggregations, set operations, and window functions. The PartitionedHashTable structure supports no more than 16 sub-HashTables. It also supports the parallel merging of HashTables and each sub-Hash Join can be scaled independently. These can reduce overall memory usage and the latency caused by scaling.\\n\\nIf the current HashTable is smaller than 8M, it will be scaled by a factor of 4; \\n\\nIf it is larger than 8M, it will be scaled by a factor of 2; \\n\\nIf it is smaller than 2G, it will be scaled when it is 50% full;\\n\\nAnd if it is larger than 2G, it will be scaled when it is 75% full. \\n\\nThe newly created HashTables will be pre-scaled based on how much data it is going to have. We also provide different types of HashTables for different scenarios. For example, for aggregations, you can apply PHmap.\\n\\n**3. PODArray**\\n\\nPODArray, as the name suggests, is a dynamic array of POD. The difference between it and `std::vector` is that PODArray does not initialize elements. It supports memory alignment and some interfaces of `std::vector`. It is scaled by a factor of 2. In destruction, instead of calling the destructor function for each element, it releases memory of the whole PODArray. PODArray is mainly used to save strings in columns and is applicable in many function computation and expression filtering.\\n\\n### Memory Interface\\n\\nAs the only interface that coordinates Arena, PODArray, and HashTable, the Allocator executes memory mapping (MMAP) allocation for requests larger than 64M. Those smaller than 4K will be directly allocated from the system via malloc/free; and those in between will be accelerated by a general-purpose caching ChunkAllocator, which brings a 10% performance increase according to our benchmarking results. The ChunkAllocator will try and retrieve a chunk of the specified size from the FreeList of the current core in a lock-free manner; if such a chunk doesn\'t exist, it will try from other cores in a lock-based manner; if that still fails, it will request the specified memory size from the system and encapsulate it into a chunk.\\n\\nWe chose Jemalloc over TCMalloc after experience with both of them. We tried TCMalloc in our high-concurrency tests and noticed that Spin Lock in CentralFreeList took up 40% of the total query time. Disabling \\"aggressive memory decommit\\" made things better, but that brought much more memory usage, so we had to use an individual thread to regularly recycle cache. Jemalloc, on the other hand, was more performant and stable in high-concurrency queries. After fine-tuning for other scenarios, it delivered the same performance as TCMalloc but consumed less memory.\\n\\n### Memory Reuse\\n\\nMemory reuse is widely executed on the execution layer of Apache Doris. For example, data blocks will be reused throughout the execution of a query. During Shuffle, there will be two blocks at the Sender end and they work alternately, one receiving data and the other in RPC transport. When reading a tablet, Doris will reuse the predicate column, implement cyclic reading, filter, copy filtered data to the upper block, and then clear. When ingesting data into an Aggregate Key table, once the MemTable that caches data reaches a certain size, it will be pre-aggregated and then more data will be written in. \\n\\nMemory reuse is executed in data scanning, too. Before the scanning starts, a number of free blocks (depending on the number of scanners and threads) will be allocated to the scanning task. During each scanner scheduling, one of the free blocks will be passed to the storage layer for data reading. After data reading, the block will be put into the producer queue for consumption of the upper operators in subsequent computation. Once an upper operator has copied the computation data from the block, the block will go back in the free blocks for next scanner scheduling. The thread the preallocates the free blocks will also be responsible for freeing them up after data scanning, so there won\'t be extra overheads. The number of free blocks somehow determines the concurrency of data scanning.\\n\\n## Memory Tracking\\n\\n Apache Doris uses MemTrackers to follow up on the allocation and releasing of memory while analyzing memory hotspots. The MemTrackers keep records of each data query, data ingestion, data compaction task, and the memory size of each global object, such as Cache and TabletMeta. It supports both manual counting and MemHook auto-tracking. Users can view the real-time memory usage in Doris backend on a Web page. \\n\\n### Structure of MemTrackers\\n\\nThe MemTracker system before Apache Doris 1.2.0 was in a hierarchical tree structure, consisting of process_mem_tracker, query_pool_mem_tracker, query_mem_tracker, instance_mem_tracker, ExecNode_mem_tracker and so on. MemTrackers of two neighbouring layers are of parent-child relationship. Hence, any calculation mistakes in a child MemTracker will be accumulated all the way up and result in a larger scale of incredibility. \\n\\n![](../static/images/OOM_4.png)\\n\\nIn Apache Doris 1.2.0 and newer, we made the structure of MemTrackers much simpler. MemTrackers are only divided into two types based on their roles: **MemTracker Limiter** and the others. MemTracker Limiter, monitoring memory usage, is unique in every query/ingestion/compaction task and global object; while the other MemTrackers traces the memory hotspots in query execution, such as HashTables in Join/Aggregation/Sort/Window functions and intermediate data in serialization, to give a picture of how memory is used in different operators or provide reference for memory control in data flushing.\\n\\nThe parent-child relationship between MemTracker Limiter and other MemTrackers is only manifested in snapshot printing. You can think of such a relationship as a symbolic link. They are not consumed at the same time, and the lifecycle of one does not affect that of the other. This makes it much easier for developers to understand and use them. \\n\\nMemTrackers (including MemTracker Limiter and the others) are put into a group of Maps. They allow users to print overall MemTracker type snapshot, Query/Load/Compaction task snapshot, and find out the Query/Load with the most memory usage or the most memory overusage. \\n\\n![](../static/images/OOM_5.png)\\n\\n### How MemTracker Works\\n\\nTo calculate memory usage of a certain execution, a MemTracker is added to a stack in Thread Local of the current thread. By reloading the malloc/free/realloc in Jemalloc or TCMalloc, MemHook obtains the actual size of the memory allocated or released, and records it in Thread Local of the current thread. When an execution is done, the relevant MemTracker will be removed from the stack. At the bottom of the stack is the MemTracker that records memory usage during the whole query/load execution process.\\n\\nNow let me explain with a simplified query execution process.\\n\\n- After a Doris backend node starts, the memory usage of all threads will be recorded in the Process MemTracker.\\n- When a query is submitted, a **Query MemTracker** will be added to the Thread Local Storage(TLS) Stack in the fragment execution thread.\\n- Once a ScanNode is scheduled, a **ScanNode MemTracker** will be added to Thread Local Storage(TLS) Stack in the fragment execution thread. Then, any memory allocated or released in this thread will be recorded into both the Query MemTracker and the ScanNode MemTracker.\\n- After a Scanner is scheduled, a Query MemTracker and a **Scanner MemTracker** will be added to the TLS Stack of the Scanner thread.\\n- When the scanning is done, all MemTrackers in the Scanner Thread TLS Stack will be removed. When the ScanNode scheduling is done, the ScanNode MemTracker will be removed from the fragment execution thread. Then, similarly, when an aggregation node is scheduled, an **AggregationNode MemTracker** will be added to the fragment execution thread TLS Stack, and get removed after the scheduling is done.\\n- If the query is completed, the Query MemTracker will be removed from the fragment execution thread TLS Stack. At this point, this stack should be empty. Then, from the QueryProfile, you can view the peak memory usage during the whole query execution as well as each phase (scanning, aggregation, etc.).\\n\\n![](../static/images/OOM_6.png)\\n\\n### How to Use MemTracker\\n\\nThe Doris backend Web page demonstrates real-time memory usage, which is divided into types: Query/Load/Compaction/Global. Current memory consumption and peak consumption are shown. \\n\\n![](../static/images/OOM_7.png)\\n\\nThe Global types include MemTrackers of Cache and TabletMeta.\\n\\n![](../static/images/OOM_8.png)\\n\\nFrom the Query types, you can see the current memory consumption and peak consumption of the current query and the operators it involves (you can tell how they are related from the labels). For memory statistics of historical queries, you can check the Doris FE audit logs or BE INFO logs.\\n\\n![](../static/images/OOM_9.png)\\n\\n## Memory Limit\\n\\nWith widely implemented memory tracking in Doris backends, we are one step closer to eliminating OOM, the cause of backend downtime and large-scale query failures. The next step is to optimize the memory limit on queries and processes to keep memory usage under control.\\n\\n### Memory Limit on Query\\n\\nUsers can put a memory limit on every query. If that limit is exceeded during execution, the query will be canceled. But since version 1.2, we have allowed Memory Overcommit, which is a more flexible memory limit control. If there are sufficient memory resources, a query can consume more memory than the limit without being canceled, so users don\'t have to pay extra attention to memory usage; if there are not, the query will wait until new memory space is allocated; only when the newly freed up memory is not enough for the query will the query be canceled.\\n\\nWhile in Apache Doris 2.0, we have realized exception safety for queries. That means any insufficient memory allocation will immediately cause the query to be canceled, which saves the trouble of checking \\"Cancel\\" status in subsequent steps.\\n\\n### Memory Limit on Process\\n\\nOn a regular basis, Doris backend retrieves the physical memory of processes and the currently available memory size from the system. Meanwhile, it collects MemTracker snapshots of all Query/Load/Compaction tasks. If a backend process exceeds its memory limit or there is insufficient memory, Doris will free up some memory space by clearing Cache and cancelling a number of queries or data ingestion tasks. These will be executed by an individual GC thread regularly.\\n\\n![](../static/images/OOM_10.png)\\n\\nIf the process memory consumed is over the SoftMemLimit (81% of total system memory, by default), or the available system memory drops below the Warning Water Mark (less than 3.2GB), **Minor GC** will be triggered. At this moment, query execution will be paused at the memory allocation step, the cached data in data ingestion tasks will be force flushed, and part of the Data Page Cache and the outdated Segment Cache will be released. If the newly released memory does not cover 10% of the process memory, with Memory Overcommit enabled, Doris will start cancelling the queries which are the biggest \\"overcommitters\\" until the 10% target is met or all queries are canceled. Then, Doris will shorten the system memory checking interval and the GC interval. The queries will be continued after more memory is available.\\n\\nIf the process memory consumed is beyond the MemLimit (90% of total system memory, by default), or the available system memory drops below the Low Water Mark (less than 1.6GB), **Full GC** will be triggered. At this time, data ingestion tasks will be stopped, and all Data Page Cache and most other Cache will be released. If, after all these steps, the newly released memory does not cover 20% of the process memory, Doris will look into all MemTrackers and find the most memory-consuming queries and ingestion tasks, and cancel them one by one. Only after the 20% target is met will the system memory checking interval and the GC interval be extended, and the queries and ingestion tasks be continued. (One garbage collection operation usually takes hundreds of \u03bcs to dozens of ms.)\\n\\n## Influences and Outcomes\\n\\nAfter optimizations in memory allocation, memory tracking, and memory limit, we have substantially increased the stability and high-concurrency performance of Apache Doris as a real-time analytic data warehouse platform. OOM crash in the backend is a rare scene now. Even if there is an OOM, users can locate the problem root based on the logs and then fix it. In addition, with more flexible memory limits on queries and data ingestion, users don\'t have to spend extra effort taking care of memory when memory space is adequate. \\n\\nIn the next phase, we plan to ensure completion of queries in memory overcommitment, which means less queries will have to be canceled due to memory shortage. We have broken this objective into specific directions of work: exception safety, memory isolation between resource groups, and the flushing mechanism of intermediate data.

See the License for the\\nspecific language governing permissions and limitations\\nunder the License.\\n--\x3e\\n\\nWhat is compaction in database? Think of your disks as a warehouse: The compaction mechanism is like a team of storekeepers (with genius organizing skills like Marie Kondo) who help put away the incoming data. \\n\\nIn particular, the data (which is the inflowing cargo in this metaphor) comes in on a \\"conveyor belt\\", which does not allow cutting in line. This is how the **LSM-Tree** (Log Structured-Merge Tree) works: In data storage, data is written into **MemTables** in an append-only manner, and then the MemTables are flushed to disks to form files. (These files go by different names in different databases. In my community, we call them **Rowsets**). Just like putting small boxes of cargo into a large container, compaction means merging multiple small rowset files into a big one, but it does much more than that. Like I said, the compaction mechanism is an organizing magician: \\n\\n- Although the items (data) in each box (rowset) are orderly arranged, the boxes themselves are not. Hence, one thing that the \\"storekeepers\\" do is to sort the boxes (rowsets) in a certain order so they can be quickly found once needed (quickening data reading).\\n- If an item needs to be discarded or replaced, since no line-jump is allowed on the conveyor belt (append-only), you can only put a \\"note\\" (together with the substitution item) at the end of the queue on the belt to remind the \\"storekeepers\\", who will later perform replacing or discarding for you.\\n- If needed, the \\"storekeepers\\" are even kind enough to pre-process the cargo for you (pre-aggregating data to reduce computation burden during data reading). \\n\\n![](../static/images/Compaction_1.png)\\n\\nAs helpful as the \\"storekeepers\\" are, they can be troublemakers at times \u2014 that\'s why \\"team management\\" matters. For the compaction mechanism to work efficiently, you need wise planning and scheduling, or else you might need to deal with high memory and CPU usage, if not OOM in the backend or write error.\\n\\nSpecifically, efficient compaction is added up by quick triggering of compaction tasks, controllable memory and CPU overheads, and easy parameter adjustment from the engineer\'s side. That begs the question: **How**? In this post, I will show you our way, including how we trigger, execute, and fine-tune compaction for faster and less resource-hungry execution.\\n\\n## Trigger Strategies\\n\\nThe overall objective here is to trigger compaction tasks timely with the least resource consumption possible.\\n\\n### Active Trigger\\n\\nThe most intuitive way to ensure timely compaction is to scan for potential compaction tasks upon data ingestion. Every time a new data tablet version is generated, a compaction task is triggered immediately, so you will never have to worry about version buildup. But this only works for newly ingested data. This is called **Cumulative Compaction**, as opposed to **Base Compaction**, which is the compaction of existing data.\\n\\n### Passive Scan\\n\\nBase compaction is triggered by passive scan. Passive scan is a much heavier job than active trigger, because it scans all metadata in all data tablets in the node. After identifying all potential compaction tasks, the system starts compaction for the most urgent data tablet.\\n\\n### Tablet Dormancy\\n\\nFrequent metadata scanning is a waste of CPU resources, so it is better to introduce domancy: For tablets that have been producing no compaction tasks for long, the system just stops looking at them for a while. If there is a sudden data-write on a dormant tablet, that will trigger cumulative compaction as mentioned above, so no worries, you won\'t miss anything.\\n\\nThe combination of these three strategies is an example of cost-effective planning.\\n\\n## Execution\\n\\n### Vertical Compaction for Columnar Storage\\n\\nAs columnar storage is the future for analytic databases, the execution of compaction should adapt to that. We call it vertical compaction. I illustrate this mechanism with the figure below:\\n\\n![](../static/images/Compaction_2.png)\\n\\nHope all these tiny blocks and numbers don\'t make you dizzy. Actually, vertical compaction can be broken down into four simple steps:\\n\\n1. **Separate key columns and value columns**. Split out all key columns from the input rowsets and put them into one group, and all value columns into N groups.\\n2. **Merge the key columns**. Heap sort is used in this step. The product here is a merged and ordered key column as well as a global sequence marker (**RowSources**).\\n3. **Merge the value columns**. The value columns are merged and organized based on the sequence in **RowSources**. \\n4. **Write the data**. All columns are assembled together and form one big rowset.\\n\\nAs a supporting technique for columnar storage, vertical compaction avoids the need to load all columns in every merging operation. That means it can vastly reduce memory usage compared to traditional row-oriented compaction.\\n\\n### Segment Compaction to Avoid \\"Jams\\"\\n\\nAs described in the beginning, in data ingestion, data will first be piled in the memory until it reaches a certain size, and then flushed to disks and stored in the form of files. Therefore, if you have ingested one huge batch of data at a time, you will have a large number of newly generated files on the disks. That adds to the scanning burden during data reading, and thus slows down data queries. (Imagine that suddenly you have to look into 50 boxes instead of 5, to find the item you need. That\'s overwhelming.) In some databases, such explosion of files could even trigger a protection mechanism that suspends data ingestion.\\n\\nSegment compaction is the way to avoid that. It allows you to compact data at the same time you ingest it, so that the system can ingest a larger data size quickly without generating too many files. \\n\\nThis is a flow chart that explains how segment compaction works:\\n\\n![](../static/images/Compaction_3.png)\\n\\nSegment compaction will be triggered once the number of newly generated files exceeds a certain limit (let\'s say, 10). It is executed asynchronously by a specialized merging thread. Every 10 files will be merged into one, and the original 10 files will be deleted. Segment compaction does not prolong the data ingestion process by much, but it can largely accelerate data queries.\\n\\n### Ordered Data Compaction\\n\\nTime series data analysis is an increasingly common analytic scenario. \\n\\nTime series data is \\"born orderly\\". It is already arranged chronologically, it is written at a regular pace, and every batch of it is of similar size. It is like the least-worried-about child in the family. Correspondingly, we have a tailored compaction method for it: ordered data compaction.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Compaction_4.png)\\n\\nOrdered data compaction is even simpler:\\n\\n1. **Upload**: Jot down the Min/Max Keys of the input rowset files.\\n2. **Check**: Check if the rowset files are organized correctly based on the Min/Max Keys and the file size.\\n3. **Merge**: Hard link the input rowsets to the new rowset, and create metadata for the new rowset (including number of rows, file size, Min/Max Key, etc.)\\n\\nSee? It is a super neat and lightweight workload, involving only file linking and metadata creation. Statistically, **it just takes milliseconds to compact huge amounts of time series data but consumes nearly zero memory**.\\n\\nSo far, these are strategic and algorithmic optimizations for compaction, implemented by [Apache Doris 2.0.0](https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/19231), a unified analytic database. Apart from these, we, as developers for the open source project, have fine-tuned it from an engineering perspective.\\n\\n## Engineering Optimizations\\n\\n### Zero-Copy\\n\\nIn the backend nodes of Apache Doris, data goes through a few layers: Tablet -> Rowset -> Segment -> Column -> Page. The compaction process involves data transferring that consumes a lot of CPU resources. So we designed zero-copy compaction logic, which is realized by a data structure named BlockView. This brings another 5% increase in compaction efficiency.\\n\\n### Load-on-Demand\\n\\nIn most cases, the rowsets are not 100% orderless, so we can take advantage of such partial orderliness. For a group of ordered rowsets, Apache Doris only loads the first one and then starts merging. As the merging goes on, it gradually loads the rowset files it needs. This is how it decreases memory usage. \\n\\n### **Idle Schedule**\\n\\nAccording to our experience, base compaction tasks are often resource-intensive and time-consuming, so they can easily stand in the way of data queries. Doris 2.0.0 enables Idle Schedule, deprioritizing those base compaction tasks with huge data, long execution, and low compaction rate. \\n\\n## Parameter Optimizations\\n\\nEvery data engineer has somehow been harassed by complicated parameters and configurations. To protect our users from this nightmare, we have provided a streamlined set of parameters with the best-performing default configurations in the general environment.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis is how we keep our \\"storekeepers\\" working efficiently and cost-effectively. If you wonder how these strategies and optimization work in real practice, we tested Apache Doris with ClickBench. It reaches a **compaction speed of 300,000 row/s**; in high-concurrency scenarios, it maintains **a stable compaction score of around 50**. Also, we are planning to implement auto-tuning and increase observability for the compaction mechanism. If you are interested in the [Apache Doris](https://github.com/apache/doris) project and what we do, this is a group of visionary and passionate [developers](https://t.co/KcxAtAJZjZ) that you can talk to."},{"id":"/360","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/360","source":"@site/blog/360.md","title":"A/B Testing was a Handful, Until we Found the Replacement for Druid","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2023-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 1, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Best Practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/best-practice"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Heyu Dou, Xinxin Wang"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"A/B Testing was a Handful, Until we Found the Replacement for Druid","summary":"The recipe for successful A/B testing is quick computation, no duplication, and no data loss.

It is also a complicated kind of analysis of immense data. In our case, we have a real-time data volume of millions of OPS (Operations Per Second), with each operation involving around 20 data tags and over a dozen dimensions.\\n\\nFor effective A/B testing, as data engineers, we must ensure quick computation as well as high data integrity (which means no duplication and no data loss). I\'m sure I\'m not the only one to say this: it is hard!\\n\\nLet me show you our long-term struggle with our previous Druid-based data platform.\\n\\n## Platform Architecture 1.0\\n\\n**Components**: Apache Storm + Apache Druid + MySQL\\n\\nThis was our real-time datawarehouse, where Apache Storm was the real-time data processing engine and Apache Druid pre-aggregated the data. However, Druid did not support certain paging and join queries, so we wrote data from Druid to MySQL regularly, making MySQL the \\"materialized view\\" of Druid. But that was only a duct tape solution as it couldn\'t support our ever enlarging real-time data size. So data timeliness was unattainable.\\n\\n![](../static/images/360_1.png)\\n\\n## Platform Architecture 2.0\\n\\n**Components**: Apache Flink + Apache Druid + TiDB\\n\\nThis time, we replaced Storm with Flink, and MySQL with TiDB. Flink was more powerful in terms of semantics and features, while TiDB, with its distributed capability, was more maintainable than MySQL. But architecture 2.0 was nowhere near our goal of end-to-end data consistency, either, because when processing huge data, enabling TiDB transactions largely slowed down data writing. Plus, Druid itself did not support standard SQL, so there were some learning costs and frictions in usage.\\n\\n![](../static/images/360_2.png)\\n\\n## Platform Architecture 3.0\\n\\n**Components**: Apache Flink + [Apache Doris](https://github.com/apache/doris)\\n\\nWe replaced Apache Druid with Apache Doris as the OLAP engine, which could also serve as a unified data serving gateway. So in Architecture 3.0, we only need to maintain one set of query logic. And we layered our real-time datawarehouse to increase reusability of real-time data.\\n\\n![](../static/images/360_3.png)\\n\\nTurns out the combination of Flink and Doris was the answer. We can exploit their features to realize quick computation and data consistency. Keep reading and see how we make it happen.\\n\\n## Quick Computation\\n\\nAs one piece of operation data can be attached to 20 tags, in A/B testing, we compare two groups of data centering only one tag each time. At first, we thought about splitting one piece of operation data (with 20 tags) into 20 pieces of data of only one tag upon data ingestion, and then importing them into Doris for analysis, but that could cause a data explosion and thus huge pressure on our clusters. \\n\\nThen we tried moving part of such workload to the computation engine. So we tried and \\"exploded\\" the data in Flink, but soon regretted it, because when we aggregated the data using the global hash windows in Flink jobs, the network and CPU usage also \\"exploded\\".\\n\\nOur third shot was to aggregate data locally in Flink right after we split it. As is shown below, we create a window in the memory of one operator for local aggregation; then we further aggregate it using the global hash windows. Since two operators chained together are in one thread, transferring data between operators consumes much less network resources. **The two-step aggregation method, combined with the** **[Aggregate model](https://doris.apache.org/docs/dev/data-table/data-model)** **of Apache Doris, can keep data explosion in a manageable range.**\\n\\n![](../static/images/360_4.png)\\n\\nFor convenience in A/B testing, we make the test tag ID the first sorted field in Apache Doris, so we can quickly locate the target data using sorted indexes. To further minimize data processing in queries, we create materialized views with the frequently used dimensions. With constant modification and updates, the materialized views are applicable in 80% of our queries.\\n\\nTo sum up, with the application of sorted index and materialized views, we reduce our query response time to merely seconds in A/B testing.\\n\\n## Data Integrity Guarantee\\n\\nImagine that your algorithm designers worked sweat and tears trying to improve the business, only to find their solution unable to be validated by A/B testing due to data loss. This is an unbearable situation, and we make every effort to avoid it.\\n\\n### Develop a Sink-to-Doris Component\\n\\nTo ensure end-to-end data integrity, we developed a Sink-to-Doris component. It is built on our own Flink Stream API scaffolding and realized by the idempotent writing of Apache Doris and the two-stage commit mechanism of Apache Flink. On top of it, we have a data protection mechanism against anomalies. \\n\\nIt is the result of our long-term evolution. We used to ensure data consistency by implementing \\"one writing for one tag ID\\". Then we realized we could make good use of the transactions in Apache Doris and the two-stage commit of Apache Flink. \\n\\n![](../static/images/360_5.png)\\n\\nAs is shown above, this is how two-stage commit works to guarantee data consistency:\\n\\n1. Write data into local files;\\n2. Stage One: pre-commit data to Apache Doris. Save the Doris transaction ID into status;\\n3. If checkpoint fails, manually abandon the transaction; if checkpoint succeeds, commit the transaction in Stage Two;\\n4. If the commit fails after multiple retries, the transaction ID and the relevant data will be saved in HDFS, and we can restore the data via Broker Load.\\n\\nWe make it possible to split a single checkpoint into multiple transactions, so that we can prevent one Stream Load from taking more time than a Flink checkpoint in the event of large data volumes.\\n\\n### Application Display\\n\\nThis is how we implement Sink-to-Doris. The component has blocked API calls and topology assembly. With simple configuration, we can write data into Apache Doris via Stream Load. \\n\\n![](../static/images/360_6.png)\\n\\n### Cluster Monitoring\\n\\nFor cluster and host monitoring, we adopted the metrics templates provided by the Apache Doris community. For data monitoring, in addition to the template metrics, we added Stream Load request numbers and loading rates.\\n\\n![](../static/images/360_7.png)\\n\\nOther metrics of our concerns include data writing speed and task processing time. In the case of anomalies, we will receive notifications in the form of phone calls, messages, and emails.\\n\\n![](../static/images/360_8.png)\\n\\n## Key Takeaways\\n\\nThe recipe for successful A/B testing is quick computation and high data integrity. For this purpose, we implement a two-step aggregation method in Apache Flink, utilize the Aggregate model, materialized view, and short indexes of Apache Doris. Then we develop a Sink-to-Doris component, which is realized by the idempotent writing of Apache Doris and the two-stage commit mechanism of Apache Flink."},{"id":"/Inverted Index","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Inverted Index","source":"@site/blog/Inverted Index.md","title":"Building A Log Analytics Solution 10 Times More Cost-Effective Than Elasticsearch","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2023-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 26, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Tech Sharing","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-sharing"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Apache Doris"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Building A Log Analytics Solution 10 Times More Cost-Effective Than Elasticsearch","summary":"Apache Doris has introduced inverted indexes in version 2.0.0 and further optimized it to realize two times faster log query performance than Elasticsearch with 1/5 of the storage space it uses.","date":"2023-05-26","author":"Apache Doris","tags":["Tech Sharing"]},"prevItem":{"title":"A/B Testing was a Handful, Until we Found the Replacement for Druid","permalink":"/blog/360"},"nextItem":{"title":"Building a Data Warehouse for Traditional Industry","permalink":"/blog/Midland Realty"}},"content":"\x3c!-- \\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\\nor more contributor license agreements.

Examples of logs include business logs (such as user activity logs), and Operation & Maintenance logs of servers, databases, and network or IoT devices.\\n\\nLogs are the guardian angel of business. On the one hand, they provide system risk alerts and help engineers in troubleshooting. On the other hand, if you zoom them out by time range, you might identify some helpful trends and patterns, not to mention that business logs are the cornerstone of user insights.\\n\\nHowever, logs can be a handful, because:\\n\\n- **They flow in like crazy.** Every system event or click from user generates a log. A company often produces tens of billions of new logs per day.\\n- **They are bulky.** Logs are supposed to stay. They might not be useful until they are. So a company can accumulate up to PBs of log data, many of which are seldom visited but take up huge storage space. \\n- **They must be quick to load and find.** Locating the target log for troubleshooting is literally like looking for a needle in a haystack. People long for real-time log writing and real-time responses to log queries. \\n\\nNow you can see a clear picture of what an ideal log processing system is like. It should support:\\n\\n- **High-throughput real-time data ingestion:** It should be able to write blogs in bulk, and make them visible immediately.\\n- **Low-cost storage:** It should be able to store substantial amounts of logs without costing too many resources.\\n- **Real-time text search:** It should be capable of quick text search.\\n\\n## Common Solutions: Elasticsearch & Grafana Loki\\n\\nThere exist two common log processing solutions within the industry, exemplified by Elasticsearch and Grafana Loki, respectively. \\n\\n- **Inverted index (Elasticsearch)**: It is well-embraced due to its support for full-text search and high performance. The downside is the low throughput in real-time writing and the huge resource consumption in index creation.\\n- **Lightweight index / no index (Grafana Loki)**: It is the opposite of inverted index because it boasts high real-time write throughput and low storage cost but delivers slow queries.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Inverted_1.png)\\n\\n## Introduction to Inverted Index\\n\\nA prominent strength of Elasticsearch in log processing is quick keyword search among a sea of logs. This is enabled by inverted indexes.\\n\\nInverted indexing was originally used to retrieve words or phrases in texts. The figure below illustrates how it works: \\n\\nUpon data writing, the system tokenizes texts into **terms**, and stores these terms in a **posting list** which maps terms to the ID of the row where they exist. In text queries, the database finds the corresponding **row ID** of the keyword (term) in the posting list, and fetches the target row based on the row ID. By doing so, the system won\'t have to traverse the whole dataset and thus improves query speeds by orders of magnitudes. \\n\\n![](../static/images/Inverted_2.png)\\n\\nIn inverted indexing of Elasticsearch, quick retrieval comes at the cost of writing speed, writing throughput, and storage space. Why? Firstly, tokenization, dictionary sorting, and inverted index creation are all CPU- and memory-intensive operations. Secondly, Elasticssearch has to store the original data, the inverted index, and an extra copy of data stored in columns for query acceleration. That\'s triple redundancy. \\n\\nBut without inverted index, Grafana Loki, for example, is hurting user experience with its slow queries, which is the biggest pain point for engineers in log analysis.\\n\\nSimply put, Elasticsearch and Grafana Loki represent different tradeoffs between high writing throughput, low storage cost, and fast query performance. What if I tell you there is a way to have them all? We have introduced inverted indexes in [Apache Doris 2.0.0](https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/19231) and further optimized it to realize **two times faster log query performance than Elasticsearch with 1/5 of the storage space it uses. Both factors combined, it is a 10 times better solution.** \\n\\n## Inverted Index in Apache Doris\\n\\nGenerally, there are two ways to implement indexes: **external indexing system** or **built-in indexes**.\\n\\n**External indexing system:** You connect an external indexing system to your database. In data ingestion, data is imported to both systems. After the indexing system creates indexes, it deletes the original data within itself. When data users input a query, the indexing system provides the IDs of the relevant data, and then the database looks up the target data based on the IDs. \\n\\nBuilding an external indexing system is easier and less intrusive to the database, but it comes with some annoying flaws:\\n\\n- The need to write data into two systems can result in data inconsistency and storage redundancy.\\n- Interaction between the database and the indexing system brings overheads, so when the target data is huge, the query across the two systems can be slow.\\n- It is exhausting to maintain two systems.\\n\\nIn [Apache Doris](https://github.com/apache/doris), we opt for the other way. Built-in inverted indexes are more difficult to make, but once it is done, it is faster, more user-friendly, and trouble-free to maintain.\\n\\nIn Apache Doris, data is arranged in the following format. Indexes are stored in the Index Region:\\n\\n![](../static/images/Inverted_3.png)\\n\\nWe implement inverted indexes in a non-intrusive manner:\\n\\n1. **Data ingestion & compaction**: As a segment file is written into Doris, an inverted index file will be written, too. The index file path is determined by the segment ID and the index ID. Rows in segments correspond to the docs in indexes, so are the RowID and the DocID.\\n2. **Query**: If the `where` clause includes a column with inverted index, the system will look up in the index file, return a DocID list, and convert the DocID list into a RowID Bitmap. Under the RowID filtering mechanism of Apache Doris, only the target rows will be read. This is how queries are accelerated.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Inverted_4.png)\\n\\nSuch non-intrusive method separates the index file from the data files, so you can make any changes to the inverted indexes without worrying about affecting the data files themselves or other indexes. \\n\\n## Optimizations for Inverted Index\\n\\n### General Optimizations\\n\\n**C++ Implementation and Vectorization**\\n\\nDifferent from Elasticsearch, which uses Java, Apache Doris implements C++ in its storage modules, query execution engine, and inverted indexes. Compared to Java, C++ provides better performance, allows easier vectorization, and produces no JVM GC overheads. We have vectorized every step of inverted indexing in Apache Doris, such as tokenization, index creation, and queries. To provide you with a perspective, **in inverted indexing, Apache Doris writes data at a speed of 20MB/s per core, which is four times that of Elasticsearch (5MB/s).**\\n\\n**Columnar Storage & Compression**\\n\\nApache Lucene lays the foundation for inverted indexes in Elasticsearch. As Lucene itself is built to support file storage, it stores data in a row-oriented format. \\n\\nIn Apache Doris, inverted indexes for different columns are isolated from each other, and the inverted index files adopt columnar storage to facilitate vectorization and data compression.\\n\\nBy utilizing Zstandard compression, Apache Doris realizes a compression ratio ranging from **5:1** to **10:1**, faster compression speeds, and 50% less space usage than GZIP compression.\\n\\n**BKD Trees for Numeric / Datetime Columns**\\n\\nApache Doris implements BKD trees for numeric and datetime columns. This not only increases performance of range queries, but is a more space-saving method than converting those columns to fixed-length strings. Other benefits of it include:\\n\\n1. **Efficient range queries**: It is able to quickly locate the target data range in numeric and datetime columns.\\n2. **Less storage space**: It aggregates and compresses adjacent data blocks to reduce storage costs.\\n3. **Support for multi-dimensional data**: BKD trees are scalable and adaptive to multi-dimensional data types, such as GEO points and ranges.\\n\\nIn addition to BKD trees, we have further optimized the queries on numeric and datetime columns.\\n\\n1. **Optimization for low-cardinality scenarios**: We have fine-tuned the compression algorithm for low-cardinality scenarios, so decompressing and de-serializing large amounts of inverted lists will consume less CPU resources.\\n2. **Pre-fetching**: For high-hit-rate scenarios, we adopt pre-fetching. If the hit rate exceeds a certain threshold, Doris will skip the indexing process and start data filtering.\\n\\n### Tailored Optimizations to OLAP\\n\\nLog analysis is a simple kind of query with no need for advanced features (e.g. relevance scoring in Apache Lucene). The bread and butter capability of a log processing tool is quick queries and low storage cost. Therefore, in Apache Doris, we have streamlined the inverted index structure to meet the needs of an OLAP database.\\n\\n- In data ingestion, we prevent multiple threads from writing data into the same index, and thus avoid overheads brought by lock contention.\\n- We discard forward index files and Norm files to clear storage space and reduce I/O overheads.\\n- We simplify the computation logic of relevance scoring and ranking to further reduce overheads and increase performance.\\n\\nIn light of the fact that logs are partitioned by time range and historical logs are visited less frequently. We plan to provide more granular and flexible index management in future versions of Apache Doris:\\n\\n- **Create inverted index for a specified data partition**: create index for logs of the past seven days, etc.\\n- **Delete** **inverted index for a specified data partition**: delete index for logs from over one month ago, etc. (so as to clear out index space).\\n\\n## Benchmarking\\n\\nWe tested Apache Doris on publicly available datasets against Elasticsearch and ClickHouse.\\n\\nFor a fair comparison, we ensure uniformity of testing conditions, including benchmarking tool, dataset, and hardware.\\n\\n### Apache Doris VS Elasticsearch\\n\\n**Benchmarking tool**: ES Rally, the official testing tool for Elasticsearch\\n\\n**Dataset**: 1998 World Cup HTTP Server Logs (self-contained dataset in ES Rally)\\n\\n**Data Size (Before Compression)**: 32G, 247 million rows, 134 bytes per row (on average)\\n\\n**Query**:  11 queries including keyword search, range query, aggregation, and ranking; Each query is serially executed 100 times.\\n\\n**Environment**: 3 \xd7 16C 64G cloud virtual machines\\n\\n- **Results of Apache Doris**:\\n\\n- - Writing Speed: 550 MB/s, **4.2 times that of Elasticsearch**\\n  - Compression Ratio: 10:1\\n  - Storage Usage: **20% that of Elasticsearch**\\n  - Response Time: **43% that of Elasticsearch**\\n\\n![](../static/images/Inverted_5.png)\\n\\n### Apache Doris VS ClickHouse\\n\\nAs ClickHouse launched inverted index as an experimental feature in v23.1, we tested Apache Doris with the same dataset and SQL as described in the ClickHouse [blog](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-search-with-inverted-indices), and compared performance of the two under the same testing resource, case, and tool.\\n\\n**Data**: 6.7G, 28.73 million rows, the Hacker News dataset, Parquet format\\n\\n**Query**:  3 keyword searches, counting the number of occurrence of the keywords \\"ClickHouse\\", \\"OLAP\\" OR \\"OLTP\\", and \\"avx\\" AND \\"sve\\".\\n\\n**Environment**: 1 \xd7 16C 64G cloud virtual machine\\n\\n**Result**: Apache Doris was **4.7 times, 12 times, 18.5 times** faster than ClickHouse in the three queries, respectively.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Inverted_6.png)\\n\\n## Usage & Example\\n\\n**Dataset**: one million comment records from Hacker News\\n\\n- **Step 1**: Specify inverted index to the data table upon table creation.\\n\\n- **Parameters**:\\n\\n- - INDEX idx_comment (`comment`): create an index named \\"idx_comment\\" comment for the \\"comment\\" column\\n  - USING INVERTED: specify inverted index for the table\\n  - PROPERTIES(\\"parser\\" = \\"english\\"): specify the tokenization language to English\\n\\n```SQL\\nCREATE TABLE hackernews_1m\\n(\\n    `id` BIGINT,\\n    `deleted` TINYINT,\\n    `type` String,\\n    `author` String,\\n    `timestamp` DateTimeV2,\\n    `comment` String,\\n    `dead` TINYINT,\\n    `parent` BIGINT,\\n    `poll` BIGINT,\\n    `children` Array<BIGINT>,\\n    `url` String,\\n    `score` INT,\\n    `title` String,\\n    `parts` Array<INT>,\\n    `descendants` INT,\\n    INDEX idx_comment (`comment`) USING INVERTED PROPERTIES(\\"parser\\" = \\"english\\") COMMENT \'inverted index for comment\'\\n)\\nDUPLICATE KEY(`id`)\\nDISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`id`) BUCKETS 10\\nPROPERTIES (\\"replication_num\\" = \\"1\\");\\n```\\n\\nNote: You can add index to an existing table via `ADD INDEX idx_comment ON hackernews_1m(`comment`) USING INVERTED PROPERTIES(\\"parser\\" = \\"english\\") `. Different from that of smart index and secondary index, the creation of inverted index only involves the reading of the comment column, so it can be much faster.\\n\\n**Step 2**: Retrieve the words\\"OLAP\\" and \\"OLTP\\" in the comment column with `MATCH_ALL`. The response time here was 1/10 of that in hard matching with `like`. (The performance gap widens as data volume increases.)\\n\\n```SQL\\nmysql> SELECT count() FROM hackernews_1m WHERE comment LIKE \'%OLAP%\' AND comment LIKE \'%OLTP%\';\\n+---------+\\n| count() |\\n+---------+\\n|      15 |\\n+---------+\\n1 row in set (0.13 sec)\\n\\nmysql> SELECT count() FROM hackernews_1m WHERE comment MATCH_ALL \'OLAP OLTP\';\\n+---------+\\n| count() |\\n+---------+\\n|      15 |\\n+---------+\\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\\n```\\n\\nFor more feature introduction and usage guide, see documentation: [Inverted Index](https://doris.apache.org/docs/dev/data-table/index/inverted-index/)\\n\\n## Wrap-up\\n\\nIn a word, what contributes to Apache Doris\' 10-time higher cost-effectiveness than Elasticsearch is its OLAP-tailored optimizations for inverted indexing, supported by the columnar storage engine, massively parallel processing framework, vectorized query engine, and cost-based optimizer of Apache Doris. \\n\\nAs proud as we are about our own inverted indexing solution, we understand that self-published benchmarks can be controversial, so we are open to [feedback](https://t.co/KcxAtAJZjZ) from any third-party users and see how [Apache Doris](https://github.com/apache/doris) works in real-world cases."},{"id":"/Midland Realty","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Midland Realty","source":"@site/blog/Midland Realty.md","title":"Building a Data Warehouse for Traditional Industry","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2023-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 12, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Best Practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/best-practice"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Herman Seah"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Building a Data Warehouse for Traditional Industry","summary":"The best component for you is the one that suits you most.

See the License for the\\nspecific language governing permissions and limitations\\nunder the License.\\n--\x3e\\n\\nBy Herman Seah, Data Warehouse Planner & Data Analyst at Midland Realty\\n\\nThis is a part of the digital transformation of a real estate giant. For the sake of confidentiality, I\'m not going to reveal any business data, but you\'ll get a detailed view of our data warehouse and our optimization strategies.\\n\\nNow let\'s get started.\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nLogically, our data architecture can be divided into four parts.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Midland_1.png)\\n\\n- **Data integration**: This is supported by Flink CDC, DataX, and the Multi-Catalog feature of Apache Doris.\\n- **Data management**: We use Apache Dolphinscheduler for script lifecycle management, privileges in multi-tenancy management, and data quality monitoring.\\n- **Alerting**: We use Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki to monitor component resources and logs.\\n- **Data services**: This is where BI tools step in for user interaction, such as data queries and analysis.\\n\\n### 1. **Tables**\\n\\nWe create our dimension tables and fact tables centering each operating entity in business, including customers, houses, etc. If there are a series of activities involving the same operating entity, they should be recorded by one field. (This is a lesson learned from our previous chaotic data management system.)\\n\\n### 2. **Layers**\\n\\nOur data warehouse is divided into five conceptual layers. We use Apache Doris and Apache DolphinScheduler to schedule the DAG scripts between these layers.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Midland_2.png)\\n\\nEvery day, the layers go through an overall update besides incremental updates in case of changes in historical status fields or incomplete data synchronization of ODS tables.\\n\\n### 3. **Incremental Update Strategies**\\n\\n(1) Set `where >= \\"activity time -1 day or -1 hour\\"`  instead of `where >= \\"activity time`\\n\\nThe reason for doing so is to prevent data drift caused by the time gap of scheduling scripts. Let\'s say, with the execution interval set to 10 min, suppose that the script is executed at 23:58:00 and a new piece of data arrives at 23:59:00, if we set `where >= \\"activity time`, that piece of data of the day will be missed.\\n\\n(2) Fetch the ID of the largest primary key of the table before every script execution, store the ID in the auxiliary table, and set `where >= \\"ID in auxiliary table\\"`\\n\\nThis is to avoid data duplication. Data duplication might happen if you use the Unique Key model of Apache Doris and designate a set of primary keys, because if there are any changes in the primary keys in the source table, the changes will be recorded and the relevant data will be loaded. This method can fix that, but it is only applicable when the source tables have auto-increment primary keys.\\n\\n(3) Partition the tables\\n\\nAs for time-based auto-increment data such as log tables, there might be less changes in historical data and status, but the data volume is large, so there could be huge computing pressure on overall updates and snapshot creation. Hence, it is better to partition such tables, so for each incremental update, we only need to replace one partition. (You might need to watch out for data drift, too.)\\n\\n### 4. **Overall Update Strategies**\\n\\n(1) Truncate Table\\n\\nClear out the table and then ingest all data from the source table into it. This is applicable for small tables and scenarios with no user activity in wee hours.\\n\\n(2) `ALTER TABLE tbl1 REPLACE WITH TABLE tbl2 `\\n\\nThis is an atomic operation and it is advisable for large tables. Every time before executing a script, we create a temporary table with the same schema, load all data into it, and replace the original table with it.\\n\\n## Application\\n\\n- **ETL job**: every minute\\n- **Configuration for first-time deployment**: 8 nodes, 2 frontends, 8 backends, hybrid deployment\\n- **Node configuration**: 32C * 60GB * 2TB SSD\\n\\nThis is our configuration for TBs of legacy data and GBs of incremental data. You can use it as a reference and scale your cluster on this basis. Deployment of Apache Doris is simple. You don\'t need other components.\\n\\n1. To integrate offline data and log data, we use DataX, which supports CSV format and readers of many relational databases, and Apache Doris provides a DataX-Doris-Writer.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Midland_3.png)\\n\\n2. We use Flink CDC to synchronize data from source tables. Then we aggregate the real-time metrics utilizing the Materialized View or the Aggregate Model of Apache Doris. Since we only have to process part of the metrics in a real-time manner and we don\'t want to generate too many database connections, we use one Flink job to maintain multiple CDC source tables. This is realized by the multi-source merging and full database sync features of Dinky, or you can implement a Flink DataStream multi-source merging task yourself. It is noteworthy that Flink CDC and Apache Doris support Schema Change.\\n\\n```SQL\\nEXECUTE CDCSOURCE demo_doris WITH (\\n  \'connector\' = \'mysql-cdc\',\\n  \'hostname\' = \'127.0.0.1\',\\n  \'port\' = \'3306\',\\n  \'username\' = \'root\',\\n  \'password\' = \'123456\',\\n  \'checkpoint\' = \'10000\',\\n  \'scan.startup.mode\' = \'initial\',\\n  \'parallelism\' = \'1\',\\n  \'table-name\' = \'ods.ods_*,ods.ods_*\',\\n  \'sink.connector\' = \'doris\',\\n  \'sink.fenodes\' = \'127.0.0.1:8030\',\\n  \'sink.username\' = \'root\',\\n  \'sink.password\' = \'123456\',\\n  \'sink.doris.batch.size\' = \'1000\',\\n  \'sink.sink.max-retries\' = \'1\',\\n  \'sink.sink.batch.interval\' = \'60000\',\\n  \'sink.sink.db\' = \'test\',\\n  \'sink.sink.properties.format\' =\'json\',\\n  \'sink.sink.properties.read_json_by_line\' =\'true\',\\n  \'sink.table.identifier\' = \'${schemaName}.${tableName}\',\\n  \'sink.sink.label-prefix\' = \'${schemaName}_${tableName}_1\'\\n);\\n```\\n\\n3. We use SQL scripts or \\"Shell + SQL\\" scripts, and we perform script lifecycle management. At the ODS layer, we write a general DataX job file and pass parameters for each source table ingestion, instead of writing a DataX job for each source table. In this way, we make things much easier to maintain. We manage the ETL scripts of Apache Doris on DolphinScheduler, where we also conduct version control. In case of any errors in the production environment, we can always rollback.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Midland_4.png)\\n\\n4. After ingesting data with ETL scripts, we create a page in our reporting tool. We assign different privileges to different accounts using SQL, including the privilege of modifying rows, fields, and global dictionary. Apache Doris supports privilege control over accounts, which works the same as that in MySQL. \\n\\n![](../static/images/Midland_5.png)\\n\\nWe also use Apache Doris data backup for disaster recovery, Apache Doris audit logs to monitor SQL execution efficiency, Grafana+Loki for cluster metric alerts, and Supervisor to monitor the daemon processes of node components.\\n\\n## Optimization\\n\\n### 1. Data Ingestion\\n\\nWe use DataX to Stream Load offline data. It allows us to adjust the size of each batch. The Stream Load method returns results synchronously, which meets the needs of our architecture. If we execute asynchronous data import using DolphinScheduler, the system might assume that the script has been executed, and that can cause a messup. If you use a different method, we recommend that you execute `show load` in the shell script, and check the regex filtering status to see if the ingestion succeeds.\\n\\n### 2. Data Model\\n\\nWe adopt the Unique Key model of Apache Doris for most of our tables. The Unique Key model ensures idempotence of data scripts and effectively avoids upstream data duplication. \\n\\n### 3. Reading External Data\\n\\nWe use the Multi-Catalog feature of Apache Doris to connect to external data sources. It allows us to create mappings of external data at the Catalog level.\\n\\n### 4. Query Optimization\\n\\nWe suggest that you put the most frequently used fields of non-character types (such as int and where clauses) in the first 36 bytes, so you can filter these fields within milliseconds in point queries.\\n\\n### 5. Data Dictionary\\n\\nFor us, it is important to create a data dictionary because it largely reduces personnel communication costs, which can be a headache when you have a big team. We use the `information_schema` in Apache Doris to generate a data dictionary. With it, we can quickly grasp the whole picture of the tables and fields and thus increase development efficiency.\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\n**Offline data ingestion time**: Within minutes\\n\\n**Query latency**: For tables containing over 100 million rows, Apache Doris responds to ad-hoc queries within one second, and complicated queries in five seconds.\\n\\n**Resource consumption**: It only takes up a small number of servers to build this data warehouse. The 70% compression ratio of Apache Doris saves us lots of storage resources.\\n\\n## **Experience and Conclusion**\\n\\nActually, before we evolved into our current data architecture, we tried Hive, Spark and Hadoop to build an offline data warehouse. It turned out that Hadoop was overkill for a traditional company like us since we didn\'t have too much data to process. It is important to find the component that suits you most.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Midland_6.png)\\n\\n(Our old off-line data warehouse)\\n\\nOn the other hand, to smoothen our  big data transition, we need to make our data platform as simple as possible in terms of usage and maintenance. That\'s why we landed on Apache Doris. It is compatible with MySQL protocol and provides a rich collection of functions so we don\'t have to develop our own UDFs. Also, it is composed of only two types of processes: frontends and backends, so it is easy to scale and track"},{"id":"/Douyu","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Douyu","source":"@site/blog/Douyu.md","title":"Zipping up the Lambda Architecture for 40% Faster Performance","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2023-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 5, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Best Practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/best-practice"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Tongyang Han"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Zipping up the Lambda Architecture for 40% Faster Performance","summary":"Instead of pooling real-time and offline data after they are fully ready for queries, Douyu engineers use Apache Doris to share part of the pre-query computation burden.","date":"2023-05-05","author":"Tongyang Han","tags":["Best Practice"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Building a Data Warehouse for Traditional Industry","permalink":"/blog/Midland Realty"},"nextItem":{"title":"Step-by-step Guide to Building a High-Performing Risk Data Mart","permalink":"/blog/HYXJ"}},"content":"\x3c!-- \\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\\nor more contributor license agreements.

These two types of data of ours were processed in two isolated tubes before they were pooled together and ready for searches and queries.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Douyu_1.png)\\n\\nThen we run into a few problems:\\n\\n1. **Isolation of real-time and offline data warehouses**\\n   1.  I know this is kind of the essence of Lambda architecture, but that means we could not reuse real-time data since it was not layered as offline data, so further customized development was required.\\n2. **Complex Pipeline from Data Sources to Data Application**\\n   1.  Data had to go through multi-step processing before it reached our data users. As our architecture involved too many components, navigating and maintaining these tech stacks was a lot of work.\\n3. **Lack of management of real-time data sources**\\n   1.  In extreme cases, this worked like a data silo and we had no way to find out whether the ingested data was duplicated or reusable.\\n\\nSo we decided to \\"zip up\\" the Lambda architecture a little bit. By \\"zipping up\\", I mean to introduce an OLAP engine that is capable of processing, storing, and analyzing data, so real-time data and offline data converge a little earlier than they used to. It is not a revolution of Lambda, but a minor change in the choice of components, which made our real-time data processing 40% faster.\\n\\n## **Zipping up Lambda Architecture**\\n\\nI am going to elaborate on how this is done using our data tagging process as an example.\\n\\nPreviously, our offline tags were produced by the data warehouse, put into a flat table, and then written in **HBase**, while real-time tags were produced by **Flink**, and put into **HBase** directly. Then **Spark** would work as the computing engine.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Douyu_2.png)\\n\\nThe problem with this stemmed from the low computation efficiency of **Flink** and **Spark**. \\n\\n- **Real-time tag production**: When computing real-time tags that involve data within a long time range, Flink did not deliver stable performance and consumed more resources than expected. And when a task failed, it would take a really long time for checkpoint recovery.\\n- **Tag query**: As a tag query engine, Spark could be slow.\\n\\nAs a solution, we replaced **HBase** and **Spark** with **Apache Doris**, a real-time analytic database, and moved part of the computational logic of the foregoing wide-time-range real-time tags from **Flink** to **Apache Doris**.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Douyu_3.png)\\n\\nInstead of putting our flat tables in HBase, we place them in Apache Doris. These tables are divided into partitions based on time sensitivity. Offline tags will be updated daily while real-time tags will be updated in real time. We organize these tables in the Aggregate Model of Apache Doris, which allows partial update of data.\\n\\nInstead of using Spark for queries, we parse the query rules into SQL for execution in Apache Doris. For pattern matching, we use Redis to cache the hot data from Apache Doris, so the system can respond to such queries much faster.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Douyu_4.png)\\n\\n## **Computational Pipeline of Wide-Time-Range Real-Time Tags**\\n\\nIn some cases, the computation of wide-time-range real-time tags entails the aggregation of historical (offline) data with real-time data. The following figure shows our old computational pipeline for these tags. \\n\\n![](../static/images/Douyu_5.png)\\n\\nAs you can see, it required multiple tasks to finish computing one real-time tag. Also, in complicated aggregations that involve a collection of aggregation operations, any improper resource allocation could lead to back pressure or waste of resources. This adds to the difficulty of task scheduling. The maintenance and stability guarantee of such a long pipeline could be an issue, too.\\n\\nTo improve on that, we decided to move such aggregation workload to Apache Doris.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Douyu_6.png)\\n\\nWe have around 400 million customer tags in our system, and each customer is attached with over 300 tags. We divide customers into more than 10,000 groups, and we have to update 5000 of them on a daily basis. The above improvement has sped up the computation of our wide-time-range real-time queries by **40%**.\\n\\n## Overwrite\\n\\nTo atomically replace data tables and partitions in Apache Doris, we customized the [Doris-Spark-Connector](https://github.com/apache/doris-spark-connector), and added an \\"Overwrite\\" mode to the Connector.\\n\\nWhen a Spark job is submitted, Apache Doris will call an interface to fetch information of the data tables and partitions.\\n\\n- If it is a non-partitioned table, we create a temporary table for the target table, ingest data into it, and then perform atomic replacement. If the data ingestion fails, we clear the temporary table;\\n- If it is a dynamic partitioned table, we create a temporary partition for the target partition, ingest data into it, and then perform atomic replacement. If the data ingestion fails, we clear the temporary partition;\\n- If it is a non-dynamic partitioned table, we need to extend the Doris-Spark-Connector parameter configuration first. Then we create a temporary partition and take steps as above.\\n\\n##  Conclusion\\n\\nOne prominent advantage of Lambda architecture is the stability it provides. However, in our practice, the processing of real-time data and offline data sometimes intertwines. For example, the computation of certain real-time tags requires historical (offline) data. Such interaction becomes a root cause of instability. Thus, instead of pooling real-time and offline data after they are fully ready for queries, we use an OLAP engine to share part of the pre-query computation burden and make things faster, simpler, and more cost-effective."},{"id":"/HYXJ","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/HYXJ","source":"@site/blog/HYXJ.md","title":"Step-by-step Guide to Building a High-Performing Risk Data Mart","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2023-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 20, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Best Practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/best-practice"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob Chow"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Step-by-step Guide to Building a High-Performing Risk Data Mart","summary":"The key step is to leverage the Multi Catalog feature of Apache Doris to unify the heterogenous data sources.

For these purposes, we built our data processing architecture based on Greenplum and CDH. The most essential part of it is the risk data mart. \\n\\n## Risk Data Mart:  Apache Hive\\n\\nI will walk you through how the risk data mart works following the data flow: \\n\\n1. Our **business data** is imported into **Greenplum** for real-time analysis to generate BI reports. Part of this data also goes into Apache Hive for queries and modeling analysis. \\n2. Our **risk control variables** are updated into **Elasticsearch** in real time via message queues, while Elasticsearch ingests data into Hive for analysis, too.\\n3. The **risk management decision data** is passed from **MongoDB** to Hive for risk control analysis and modeling.\\n\\nSo these are the three data sources of our risk data mart.\\n\\n![](../static/images/RDM_1.png)\\n\\nThis whole architecture is built with CDH 6.0. The workflows in it can be divided into real-time data streaming and offline risk analysis.\\n\\n- **Real-time data streaming**: Real-time data from Apache Kafka will be cleaned by Apache Flink, and then written into Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch will aggregate part of the data it receives and send it for reference in risk management. \\n- **Offline risk analysis**: Based on the CDH solution and utilizing Sqoop, we ingest data from Greenplum in an offline manner. Then we put this data together with the third-party data from MongoDB. Then, after data cleaning, we pour all this data into Hive for daily batch processing and data queries.\\n\\nTo give a brief overview, these are the components that support the four features of our data processing platform:\\n\\n![](../static/images/RDM_2.png)\\n\\nAs you see, Apache Hive is central to this architecture. But in practice, it takes minutes for Apache Hive to execute analysis, so our next step is to increase query speed.\\n\\n### What are Slowing Down Our Queries?\\n\\n1. **Huge data volume in external tables**\\n\\nOur Hive-based data mart is now carrying more than 300 terabytes of data. That\'s about 20,000 tables and 5 million fields. To put them all in external tables is maintenance-intensive. Plus, data ingestion can be a big headache.\\n\\n1. **Big flat tables**\\n\\nDue to the complexity of the rule engine in risk management, our company invests a lot in the derivation of variables. In some dimensions, we have thousands of variables or even more. As a result, a few of the frequently used flat tables in Hive have over 3000 fields. So you can imagine how time consuming these queries can be.\\n\\n1. **Unstable interface**\\n\\nResults produced by daily offline batch processing will be regularly sent to our Elasticsearch clusters. (The data volume in these updates is huge, and the call of interface can get expired.) This process might cause high I/O and introduce garbage collection jitter, and further leads to unstable interface services. \\n\\nIn addition, since our risk control analysts and modeling engineers are using Hive with Spark, the expanding data architecture is also dragging down query performance.\\n\\n## A Unified Query Gateway\\n\\nWe wanted a unified gateway to manage our heterogenous data sources. That\'s why we introduced Apache Doris.\\n\\n![](../static/images/RDM_3.png)\\n\\nBut doesn\'t that make things even more complicated? Actually, no.\\n\\nWe can connect various data sources to Apache Doris and simply conduct queries on it. This is made possible by the **Multi-Catalog** feature of Apache Doris: It can interface with various data sources, including datalakes like Apache Hive, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi, and databases like MySQL, Elasticsearch, and Greenplum. That happens to cover our toolkit. \\n\\nWe create Elasticsearch Catalog and Hive Catalog in Apache Doris. These catalogs map to the external data in Elasticsearch and Hive, so we can conduct federated queries across these data sources using Apache Doris as a unified gateway. Also, we use the [Spark-Doris-Connector](https://github.com/apache/doris-spark-connector) to allow data communication between Spark and Doris. So basically, we replace Apache Hive with Apache Doris as the central hub of our data architecture. \\n\\n![](../static/images/RDM_4.png)\\n\\nHow does that affect our data processing efficiency?\\n\\n- **Monitoring & Alerting**: This is about real-time data querying. We access our real-time data in Elasticsearch clusters using Elasticsearch Catalog in Apache Doris. Then we perform queries directly in Apache Doris. It is able to return results within seconds, as opposed to the minute-level response time when we used Hive.\\n- **Query & Analysis**: As I said, we have 20,000 tables in Hive so it wouldn\'t make sense to map all of them to external tables in Hive. That would mean a hell of maintenance. Instead, we utilize the Multi Catalog feature of Apache Doris 1.2. It enables data mapping at the catalog level, so we can simply create one Hive Catalog in Doris before we can conduct queries. This separates query operations from the daily batching processing workload in Hive, so there will be less resource conflict.\\n- **Dashboarding**: We use Tableau and Doris to provide dashboard services. This reduces the query response time to seconds and milliseconds, compared with the several minutes back in the \\"Tableau + Hive\\" days.\\n- **Modeling**: We use Spark and Doris for aggregation modeling. The Spark-Doris-Connector allows mutual synchronization of data, so data from Doris can also be used in modeling for more accurate analysis.\\n\\n### **Cluster Monitoring in Production Environment**\\n\\nWe tested this new architecture in our production environment. We built two clusters.\\n\\n**Configuration**:\\n\\nProduction cluster: 4 frontends + 8 backends, m5d.16xlarge\\n\\nBackup cluster: 4 frontends + 4 backends, m5d.16xlarge\\n\\nThis is the monitoring board: \\n\\n![](../static/images/RDM_5.png)\\n\\nAs is shown, the queries are fast. We expected that it would take at least 10 nodes but in real cases, we mainly conduct queries via Catalogs, so we can handle this with a relatively small cluster size. The compatibility is good, too. It doesn\'t rock the rest of our existing system.\\n\\n## Guide to Faster Data Integration\\n\\nTo accelerate the regular data ingestion from Hive to Apache Doris 1.2.2, we have a solution that goes as follows:\\n\\n![](../static/images/RDM_6.png)\\n\\n**Main components:**\\n\\n- DolphinScheduler 3.1.4\\n- SeaTunnel 2.1.3\\n\\nWith our current hardware configuration, we use the Shell script mode of DolphinScheduler and call the SeaTunnel script on a regular basis. This is the configuration file of the data synchronization tasks:\\n\\n```undefined\\n  env{\\n  spark.app.name = \\"hive2doris-template\\"\\n  spark.executor.instances = 10\\n  spark.executor.cores = 5\\n  spark.executor.memory = \\"20g\\"\\n}\\nspark {\\n  spark.sql.catalogImplementation = \\"hive\\"\\n}\\nsource {\\n  hive {\\n    pre_sql = \\"select * from ods.demo_tbl where dt=\'2023-03-09\'\\"\\n    result_table_name = \\"ods_demo_tbl\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n \\ntransform {\\n}\\n \\nsink {\\n  doris {\\n      fenodes = \\"192.168.0.10:8030,192.168.0.11:8030,192.168.0.12:8030,192.168.0.13:8030\\"\\n      user = root\\n      password = \\"XXX\\"\\n      database = ods\\n      table = ods_demo_tbl\\n      batch_size = 500000\\n      max_retries = 1\\n      interval = 10000\\n      doris.column_separator = \\"\\\\t\\"\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis solution consumes less resources and memory but brings higher performance in queries and data ingestion.\\n\\n1. **Less storage costs**\\n\\n**Before**: The original table in Hive had 500 fields. It was divided into partitions by day, with 150 million pieces of data per partition. It takes **810G** to store in HDFS.\\n\\n**After**: For data synchronization, we call Spark on YARN using SeaTunnel. It can be finished within 40 minutes, and the ingested data only takes up **270G** of storage space.\\n\\n1. **Less memory usage & higher performance in queries**\\n\\n**Before**: For a GROUP BY query on the foregoing table in Hive, it occupied 720 Cores and 1.44T in YARN, and took a response time of **162 seconds**. \\n\\n**After**: We perform an aggregate query using Hive Catalog in Doris, `set exec_mem_limit=16G`, and receive the result after **58.531 seconds**. We also try and put the table in Doris and conduct the same query in Doris itself, that only takes **0.828 seconds**.\\n\\nThe corresponding statements are as follows:\\n\\n- Query in Hive, response time: 162 seconds\\n\\n```SQL\\nselect count(*),product_no   FROM ods.demo_tbl where dt=\'2023-03-09\'\\ngroup by product_no;\\n```\\n\\n- Query in Doris using Hive Catalog, response time: 58.531 seconds\\n\\n```SQL\\nset exec_mem_limit=16G\uff1b\\nselect count(*),product_no   FROM hive.ods.demo_tbl where dt=\'2023-03-09\'\\ngroup by product_no;\\n```\\n\\n- Query in Doris directly, response time: 0.828 seconds\\n\\n```SQL\\nselect count(*),product_no   FROM ods.demo_tbl where dt=\'2023-03-09\'\\ngroup by product_no;\\n```\\n\\n1. **Faster data ingestion**\\n\\n**Before**: The original table in Hive had 40 fields. It was divided into partitions by day, with 1.1 billion pieces of data per partition. It takes **806G** to store in HDFS.\\n\\n**After**: For data synchronization, we call Spark on YARN using SeaTunnel. It can be finished within 11 minutes (100 million pieces per minute ), and the ingested data only takes up **378G** of storage space.\\n\\n![](../static/images/RDM_7.png)\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThe key step to building a high-performing risk data mart is to leverage the Multi Catalog feature of Apache Doris to unify the heterogenous data sources. This not only increases our query speed but also solves a lot of the problems coming with our previous data architecture.\\n\\n1. Deploying Apache Doris allows us to decouple daily batch processing workloads with ad-hoc queries, so they don\'t have to compete for resources. This reduces the query response time from minutes to seconds.\\n2. We used to build our data ingestion interface based on Elasticsearch clusters, which could lead to garbage collection jitter when transferring large batches of offline data. When we stored the interface service dataset on Doris, no jitter was found during data writing and we were able to transfer 10 million rows within 10 minutes.\\n3. Apache Doris has been optimizing itself in many scenarios including flat tables. As far as we know, compared with ClickHouse, Apache Doris 1.2 is twice as fast in SSB-Flat-table benchmark and dozens of times faster in TPC-H benchmark.\\n4. In terms of cluster scaling and updating, we used to suffer from a big window of restoration time after configuration revision. But Doris supports hot swap and easy scaling out, so we can reboot nodes within a few seconds and minimize interruption to users caused by cluster scaling.\\n\\n(One last piece of advice for you: If you encounter any problems with deploying Apache Doris, don\'t hesitate to contact the Doris community for help, they and a bunch of SelectDB engineers will be more than happy to make your adaption journey quick and easy.)"},{"id":"/High_concurrency","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/High_concurrency","source":"@site/blog/High_concurrency.md","title":"How We Increased Database Query Concurrency by 20 Times","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2023-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 14, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Tech Sharing","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-sharing"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Apache Doris"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How We Increased Database Query Concurrency by 20 Times","summary":"In the upcoming Apache Doris 2.0, we have optimized it for high-concurrency point queries.

It should evolve with the needs of data users.\\n\\nVertically, companies now have an ever enlarging pool of data and expect a higher level of concurrency in data processing. Horizontally, they require a wider range of data analytics services. Besides traditional OLAP scenarios such as statistical reporting and ad-hoc queries, they are also leveraging data analysis in recommender systems, risk control, customer tagging and profiling, and IoT.\\n\\nAmong all these data services, point queries are the most frequent operations conducted by data users. Point query means to retrieve one or several rows from the database based on the Key. A point query only returns a small piece of data, such as the details of a shopping order, a transaction, a consumer profile, a product description, logistics status, and so on. Sounds easy, right? But the tricky part is, **a database often needs to handle tens of thousands of point queries at a time and respond to all of them in milliseconds**.\\n\\nMost current OLAP databases are built with a columnar storage engine to process huge data volumes. They take pride in their high throughput, but often underperform in high-concurrency scenarios. As a complement, many data engineers invite Key-Value stores like Apache HBase for point queries, and Redis as a cache layer to ease the burden. The downside is redundant storage and high maintenance costs.\\n\\nSince Apache Doris was born, we have been striving to make it a unified database for data queries of all sizes, including ad-hoc queries and point queries. Till now, we have already taken down the monster of high-throughput OLAP scenarios. In the upcoming Apache Doris 2.0, we have optimized it for high-concurrency point queries. Long story short, it can achieve over 30,000 QPS for a single node. \\n\\n## Five Ways to Accelerate High-Concurrency Queries\\n\\nHigh-concurrency queries are thorny because you need to handle high loads with limited system resources. That means you have to reduce the CPU, memory and I/O overheads of a single SQL as much as possible. The key is to minimize the scanning of underlying data and follow-up computing. \\n\\nApache Doris uses five methods to achieve higher QPS.\\n\\n### Partioning and Bucketing\\n\\nApache Doris shards data into a two-tiered structure: Partition and Bucket. You can use time information as the Partition Key. As for bucketing, you distribute the data into various nodes after data hashing. A wise bucketing plan can largely increase concurrency and throughput in data reading. \\n\\nThis is an example:\\n\\n```SQL\\nselect * from user_table where id = 5122 and create_date = \'2022-01-01\'\\n```\\n\\nIn this case, the user has set 10 buckets. `create_date` is the Partition Key and `id` is the Bucket Key. After dividing the data into partitions and buckets, the system only needs to scan one bucket in one partition before it can locate the needed data. This is a huge time saver.\\n\\n### Index\\n\\nApache Doris uses various data indexes to speed up data reading and filtering, including smart indexes and secondary indexes. Smart indexes are auto-generated by Doris upon data ingestion, which requires no action from the user\'s side. \\n\\nThere are two types of smart indexes:\\n\\n- **Sorted Index**: Apache Doris stores data in an orderly way. It creates a sorted index for every 1024 rows of data. The Key in the index is the value of the sorted column in the first row of the current 1024 rows. If the query involves the sorted column, the system will locate the first row of the relevant 1024 row group and start scanning there.\\n- **ZoneMap Index**: These are indexes on the Segment and Page level. The maximum and minimum values of each column within a Page will be recorded, so are those within a Segment. Hence, in equivalence queries and range queries, the system can narrow down the filter range with the help of the MinMax indexes.\\n\\nSecondary indexes are created by users. These include Bloom Filter indexes, Bitmap indexes, [Inverted indexes](https://doris.apache.org/docs/dev/data-table/index/inverted-index/), and [NGram Bloom Filter indexes](https://doris.apache.org/docs/dev/data-table/index/ngram-bloomfilter-index/). (If you are interested, I will go into details about them in future articles.)\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```SQL\\nselect * from user_table where id > 10 and id < 1024\\n```\\n\\nSuppose that the user has designated `id` as the Key during table creation, the data will be sorted by `id` on Memtable and the disks. So any queries involving `id` as a filter condition will be executed much faster with the aid of sorted indexes. Specifically, the data in storage will be put into multiple ranges based on `id`, and the system will implement binary search to locate the exact range according to the sorted indexes. But that could still be a large range since the sorted indexes are sparse. You can further narrow it down based on ZoneMap indexes, Bloom Filter indexes, and Bitmap indexes. \\n\\nThis is another way to reduce data scanning and improve overall concurrency of the system.\\n\\n### Materialized View\\n\\nThe idea of materialized view is to trade space for time: You execute pre-computation with pre-defined SQL statements, and perpetuate the results in a table that is visible to users but occupies some storage space. In this way, Apache Doris can respond much faster to queries for aggregated data and breakdown data and those involve the matching of sorted indexes once it hits a materialized view. This is a good way to lessen computation, improve query performance, and reduce resource consumption.\\n\\n```SQL\\n// For an aggregation query, the system reads the pre-aggregated columns in the materialized view.\\n\\ncreate materialized view store_amt as select store_id, sum(sale_amt) from sales_records group by store_id;\\nSELECT store_id, sum(sale_amt) FROM sales_records GROUP BY store_id;\\n\\n// For a query where k3 matches the sorted column in the materialized view, the system directly performs the query on the materialized view. \\n\\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_1 as SELECT k3, k2, k1 FROM tableA ORDER BY k3;\\nselect k1, k2, k3 from table A where k3=3;\\n```\\n\\n### Runtime Filter\\n\\nApart from filtering data by indexes, Apache Doris has a dynamic filtering mechanism: Runtime Filter. \\n\\nIn multi-table Join queries, the left table is usually called ProbeTable while the right one is called BuildTable, with the former much bigger than the latter. In query execution, firstly, the system reads the right table and creates a HashTable (Build) in the memory. Then, it starts reading the left table row by row, during which it also compares data between the left table and the HashTable and returns the matched data (Probe). \\n\\nSo what\'s new about that in Apache Doris? During the creation of HashTable, Apache Doris generates a filter for the columns. It can be a Min/Max filter or an IN filter. Then it pushes down the filter to the left table, which can use the filter to screen out data and thus reduces the amount of data that the Probe node has to transfer and compare. \\n\\nThis is how the Runtime Filter works. In most Join queries, the Runtime Filter can be automatically pushed down to the most underlying scan nodes or to the distributed Shuffle Join. In other words, Runtime Filter is able to reduce data reading and shorten response time for most Join queries.\\n\\n### TOP-N Optimization\\n\\nTOP-N query is a frequent scenario in data analysis. For example, users want to fetch the most recent 100 orders, or the 5 highest/lowest priced products. The performance of such queries determines the quality of real-time analysis. For them, Apache Doris implements TOP-N optimization. Here is how it goes:\\n\\n1. Apache Doris reads the sorted fields and query fields from the Scanner layer, reserves only the TOP-N pieces of data by means of Heapsort, updates the real-time TOP-N results as it continues reading, and dynamically pushes them down to the Scanner. \\n2. Combing the received TOP-N range and the indexes, the Scanner can skip a large proportion of irrelevant files and data chunks and only read a small number of rows.\\n3. Queries on flat tables usually mean the need to scan massive data, but TOP-N queries only retrieve a small amount of data. The strategy here is to divide the data reading process into two stages. In stage one, the system sorts the data based on a few columns (sorted column, or condition column) and locates the TOP-N rows. In stage two, it fetches the TOP-N rows of data after data sorting, and then it retrieves the target data according to the row numbers. \\n\\nTo sum up, Apache Doris prunes the data that needs to be read and sorted, and thus substantially reduces consumption of I/O, CPU, and memory resources.\\n\\nIn addition to the foregoing five methods, Apache Doris also improves concurrency by SQL Cache, Partition Cache, and a variety of Join optimization techniques.\\n\\n## How We Bring Concurrency to the Next Level\\n\\nBy adopting the above methods, Apache Doris was able to achieve thousands of QPS per node. However, in scenarios requiring tens of thousands of QPS, it was still bottlenecked by several issues:\\n\\n- With Doris\' columnar storage engine, it was inconvenient to read rows. In flat table models, columnar storage could result in much larger I/O usage.\\n- The execution engine and query optimizer of OLAP databases were sometimes too complicated for simple queries (point queries, etc.). Such queries needed to be processed with a shorter pipeline, which should be considered in query planning.\\n- FE modules of Doris, implementing Java, were responsible for interfacing with SQL requests and parsing query plans. These processes could produce high CPU overheads in high-concurrency scenarios.\\n\\nWe optimized Apache Doris to solve these problems. ([Pull Request on Github](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/15491))\\n\\n \\n\\n### Row Storage Format\\n\\nAs we know, row storage is much more efficient when the user only queries for a single row of data. So we introduced row storage format in Apache Doris 2.0. Users can enable row storage by specifying the following property in the table creation statement.\\n\\n```SQL\\n\\"store_row_column\\" = \\"true\\"\\n```\\n\\nWe chose JSONB as the encoding format for row storage for three reasons:\\n\\n- **Flexible schema change**: If a user has added or deleted a field, or modified the type of a field, these changes must be updated in row storage in real time. So we choose to adopt the JSONB format and encode columns into JSONB fields. This makes changes in fields very easy.\\n- **High performance**:  Accessing rows in row-oriented storage is much faster than doing that in columnar storage, and it requires much less disk access in high-concurrency scenarios. Also, in some cases, you can map the column ID to the corresponding JSONB value so you can quickly access a certain column.\\n- **Less storage space**: JSONB is a compacted binary format. It consumes less space on the disk and is more cost-effective.\\n\\nIn the storage engine, row storage will be stored as a hidden column (DORIS_ROW_STORE_COL). During Memtable Flush, the columns will be encoded into JSONB and cached into this hidden column. In data reading, the system uses the Column ID to locate the column, finds the target row based on the row number, and then deserializes the relevant columns.\\n\\n### Short-Circuit\\n\\nNormally, an SQL statement is executed in three steps:\\n\\n1.  SQL Parser parses the statement to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST).\\n2.  The Query Optimizer produces an executable plan.\\n3.  Execute the plan and return the results.\\n\\nFor complex queries on massive data, it is better to follow the plan created by the Query Optimizer. However, for high-concurrency point queries requiring low latency, that plan is not only unnecessary but also brings extra overheads. That\'s why we implement a short-circuit plan for point queries. \\n\\n![](../static/images/high-concurrency_1.png)\\n\\nOnce the FE receives a point query request, a short-circuit plan will be produced. It is a lightweight plan that involves no equivalent transformation, logic optimization or physical optimization. Instead, it conducts some basic analysis on the AST, creates a fixed plan accordingly, and finds ways to reduce overhead of the optimizer.\\n\\nFor a simple point query involving primary keys, such as `select * from tbl where pk1 = 123 and pk2 = 456`, since it only involves one single Tablet, it is better to use a lightweight RPC interface for interaction with the Storage Engine. This avoids the creation of a complicated Fragment Plan and eliminates the performance overhead brought by the scheduling under the MPP query framework.\\n\\nDetails of the RPC interface are as follows:\\n\\n```Java\\nmessage PTabletKeyLookupRequest {\\n    required int64 tablet_id = 1;\\n    repeated KeyTuple key_tuples = 2;\\n    optional Descriptor desc_tbl = 4;\\n    optional ExprList  output_expr = 5;\\n}\\n\\nmessage PTabletKeyLookupResponse {\\n    required PStatus status = 1;\\n    optional bytes row_batch = 5;\\n    optional bool empty_batch = 6;\\n}\\nrpc tablet_fetch_data(PTabletKeyLookupRequest) returns (PTabletKeyLookupResponse);\\n```\\n\\n`tablet_id` is calculated based on the primary key column, while `key_tuples` is the string format of the primary key. In this example, the `key_tuples` is similar to [\'123\', \'456\']. As BE receives the request, `key_tuples` will be encoded into primary key storage format. Then, it will locate the corresponding row number of the Key in the Segment File with the help of the primary key index, and check if that row exists in `delete bitmap`. If it does, the row number will be returned; if not, the system returns NotFound. The returned row number will be used for point query on `__DORIS_ROW_STORE_COL__`. That means we only need to locate one row in that column, fetch the original value of the JSONB format, and deserialize it.\\n\\n### Prepared Statement\\n\\nIn high-concurrency queries, part of the CPU overhead comes from SQL analysis and parsing in FE. To reduce such overhead, in FE, we provide prepared statements that are fully compatible with MySQL protocol. With prepared statements, we can achieve a four-time performance increase for primary key point queries.\\n\\n![](../static/images/high-concurrency_2.png)\\n\\nThe idea of prepared statements is to cache precomputed SQL and expressions in HashMap in memory, so they can be directly used in queries when applicable.\\n\\nPrepared statements adopt MySQL binary protocol for transmission. The protocol is implemented in the mysql_row_buffer.[h|cpp] file, and uses MySQL binary encoding. Under this protocol, the client (for example, JDBC Client) sends a pre-compiled statement to FE via `PREPARE` MySQL Command. Next, FE will parse and analyze the statement and cache it in the HashMap as shown in the figure above. Next, the client, using `EXECUTE` MySQL Command, will replace the placeholder, encode it into binary format, and send it to FE. Then, FE will perform deserialization to obtain the value of the placeholder, and generate query conditions.\\n\\n![](../static/images/high-concurrency_3.png)\\n\\nApart from caching prepared statements in FE, we also cache reusable structures in BE. These structures include pre-allocated computation blocks, query descriptors, and output expressions. Serializing and deserializing these structures often cause a CPU hotspot, so it makes more sense to cache them. The prepared statement for each query comes with a UUID named CacheID. So when BE executes the point query, it will find the corresponding class based on the CacheID, and then reuse the structure in computation.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe following example demonstrates how to use a prepared statement in JDBC:\\n\\n1. Set a JDBC URL and enable prepared statement at the server end.\\n\\n```Bash\\nurl = jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:9030/ycsb?useServerPrepStmts=true\\n```\\n\\n1. Use a prepared statement.\\n\\n```Java\\n// Use `?` as placeholder, reuse readStatement.\\nPreparedStatement readStatement = conn.prepareStatement(\\"select * from tbl_point_query where key = ?\\");\\n...\\nreadStatement.setInt(1234);\\nResultSet resultSet = readStatement.executeQuery();\\n...\\nreadStatement.setInt(1235);\\nresultSet = readStatement.executeQuery();\\n...\\n```\\n\\n### Row Storage Cache\\n\\nApache Doris has a Page Cache feature, where each page caches the data of one column. \\n\\n![](../static/images/high-concurrency_4.png)\\n\\nAs mentioned above, we have introduced row storage in Doris. The problem with this is, one row of data consists of multiple columns, so in the case of big queries, the cached data might be erased. Thus, we also introduced row cache to increase row cache hit rate.\\n\\nRow cache reuses the LRU Cache mechanism in Apache Doris. When the caching starts, the system will initialize a threshold value. If that threshold is hit, the old cached rows will be phased out. For a primary key query statement, the performance gap between cache hit and cache miss can be huge (we are talking about dozens of times less disk I/O and memory access here). So the introduction of row cache can remarkably enhance point query performance.\\n\\n![](../static/images/high-concurrency_5.png)\\n\\nTo enable row cache, you can specify the following configuration in BE:\\n\\n```JSON\\ndisable_storage_row_cache=false // This specifies whether to enable row cache; it is set to false by default.\\nrow_cache_mem_limit=20% // This specifies the percentage of row cache in the memory; it is set to 20% by default.\\n```\\n\\n## Benchmark Performance\\n\\nWe tested Apache Doris with YCSB (Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark) to see how all these optimizations work.\\n\\n**Configurations and data size:**\\n\\n- Machines: a single 16 Core 64G cloud server with 4\xd71T hard drives\\n- Cluster size: 1 Frontend + 2 Backends\\n- Data volume: 100 million rows of data, with each row taking 1KB to store; preheated\\n- Table schema and query statement:\\n\\n```JavaScript\\n// Table creation statement:\\n\\nCREATE TABLE `usertable` (\\n  `YCSB_KEY` varchar(255) NULL,\\n  `FIELD0` text NULL,\\n  `FIELD1` text NULL,\\n  `FIELD2` text NULL,\\n  `FIELD3` text NULL,\\n  `FIELD4` text NULL,\\n  `FIELD5` text NULL,\\n  `FIELD6` text NULL,\\n  `FIELD7` text NULL,\\n  `FIELD8` text NULL,\\n  `FIELD9` text NULL\\n) ENGINE=OLAP\\nUNIQUE KEY(`YCSB_KEY`)\\nCOMMENT \'OLAP\'\\nDISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`YCSB_KEY`) BUCKETS 16\\nPROPERTIES (\\n\\"replication_allocation\\" = \\"tag.location.default: 1\\",\\n\\"in_memory\\" = \\"false\\",\\n\\"persistent\\" = \\"false\\",\\n\\"storage_format\\" = \\"V2\\",\\n\\"enable_unique_key_merge_on_write\\" = \\"true\\",\\n\\"light_schema_change\\" = \\"true\\",\\n\\"store_row_column\\" = \\"true\\",\\n\\"disable_auto_compaction\\" = \\"false\\"\\n);\\n\\n// Query statement:\\n\\nSELECT * from usertable WHERE YCSB_KEY = ?\\n```\\n\\nWe run the test with the optimizations (row storage, short-circuit, and prepared statement) enabled, and then did it again with all of them disabled. Here are the results:\\n\\n![](../static/images/high-concurrency_6.png)\\n\\nWith optimizations enabled, **the average query latency decreased by a whopping 96%, the 99th percentile latency was only 1/28 of that without optimizations, and it has achieved a query concurrency of over 30,000 QPS.** This is a huge leap in performance and an over 20-time increase in concurrency.\\n\\n## Best Practice\\n\\nIt should be noted that these optimizations for point queries are implemented in the Unique Key model of Apache Doris, and you should enable Merge-on-Write and Light Schema Change for this model.\\n\\nThis is a table creation statement example for point queries:\\n\\n```undefined\\nCREATE TABLE `usertable` (\\n  `USER_KEY` BIGINT NULL,\\n  `FIELD0` text NULL,\\n  `FIELD1` text NULL,\\n  `FIELD2` text NULL,\\n  `FIELD3` text NULL\\n) ENGINE=OLAP\\nUNIQUE KEY(`USER_KEY`)\\nCOMMENT \'OLAP\'\\nDISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`USER_KEY`) BUCKETS 16\\nPROPERTIES (\\n\\"enable_unique_key_merge_on_write\\" = \\"true\\",\\n\\"light_schema_change\\" = \\"true\\",\\n\\"store_row_column\\" = \\"true\\",\\n); \\n```\\n\\n**Note:**\\n\\n- Enable `light_schema_change` to support JSONB row storage for encoding ColumnID\\n- Enable `store_row_column` to store row storage format\\n\\nFor a primary key-based point query like the one below, after table creation, you can use row storage and short-circuit execution to improve performance to a great extent.\\n\\n```SQL\\nselect * from usertable where USER_KEY = xxx;\\n```\\n\\nTo further unleash performance, you can apply prepared statement. If you have enough memory space, you can also enable row cache in the BE configuration.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn high-concurrency scenarios, Apache Doris realizes over 30,000 QPS per node after optimizations including row storage, short-circuit, prepared statement, and row cache. Also, Apache Doris is easily scaled out since it is built on MPP architecture, on top of which you can scale it up by upgrading the hardware and machine configuration. This is how Apache Doris manages to achieve both high throughput and high concurrency. It allows you to deal with various data analytic workloads on one single platform and experience quick data analytics for various scenarios. Thanks to the great efforts of the Apache Doris community and a group of excellent SelectDB engineers, Apache Doris 2.0 is about to be released soon."},{"id":"/release-1.2.3","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-1.2.3","source":"@site/blog/release-1.2.3.md","title":"Apache Doris announced the official release of version 1.2.3","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2023-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 20, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Release Notes","permalink":"/blog/tags/release-notes"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Apache Doris"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Apache Doris announced the official release of version 1.2.3","summary":"Dear community, we are excited to announce the release of Apache Doris 1.2.3 on March 30, 2023.

However, the initial data warehouses unable to store massive heterogeneous data, hence the creation of data lakes. In modern times, data lakehouse emerges as a new paradigm. It is an open data management architecture featured by strong data analytics and governance capabilities, high flexibility, and open storage.\\n\\nIf I could only use one word to describe the next-gen data lakehouse, it would be **unification:**\\n\\n- **Unified data storage** to avoid the trouble and risks brought by redundant storage and cross-system ETL.\\n- **Unified governance** of both data and metadata with support for ACID, Schema Evolution, and Snapshot.\\n- **Unified data application** that supports data access via a single interface for multiple engines and workloads.\\n\\nLet\'s look into the architecture of a data lakehouse. We will find that it is not only supported by table formats such as Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, and Delta Lake, but more importantly, it is powered by a high-performance query engine to extract value from data.\\n\\nUsers are looking for a query engine that allows quick and smooth access to the most popular data sources. What they don\'t want is for their data to be locked in a certain database and rendered unavailable for other engines or to spend extra time and computing costs on data transfer and format conversion.\\n\\nTo turn these visions into reality, a data query engine needs to figure out the following questions:\\n\\n- How to access more data sources and acquire metadata more easily?\\n- How to improve query performance on data coming from various sources?\\n- How to enable more flexible resource scheduling and workload management?\\n\\n[Apache Doris](https://github.com/apache/doris) provides a possible answer to these questions. It is a real-time OLAP database that aspires to build itself into a unified data analysis gateway. This means it needs to be easily connected to various RDBMS, data warehouses, and data lake engines (such as Hive, Iceberg, Hudi, Delta Lake, and Flink Table Store) and allow for quick data writing from and queries on these heterogeneous data sources. The rest of this article is an in-depth explanation of Apache Doris\' techniques in the above three aspects: metadata acquisition, query performance optimization, and resource scheduling.\\n\\n## Metadata Acquisition and Data Access\\n\\nApache Doris 1.2.2 supports a wide variety of data lake formats and data access from various external data sources. Besides, via the Table Value Function, users can analyze files in object storage or HDFS directly.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Lakehouse/Lakehouse_1.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nTo support multiple data sources, Apache Doris puts efforts into metadata acquisition and data access.\\n\\n### Metadata Acquisition\\n\\nMetadata consists of information about the databases, tables, partitions, indexes, and files from the data source. Thus, metadata of various data sources come in different formats and patterns, adding to the difficulty of metadata connection. An ideal metadata acquisition service should include the following:\\n\\n1. A **metadata structure** that can accommodate heterogeneous metadata.\\n2. An **extensible metadata connection framework** that enables quick and low-cost data connection.\\n3. Reliable and **efficient** **metadata access** that supports real-time metadata capture.\\n4. **Custom authentication** services to interface with external privilege management systems and thus reduce migration costs. \\n\\n#### Metadata Structure\\n\\nOlder versions of Doris support a two-tiered metadata structure: database and table. As a result, users need to create mappings for external databases and tables one by one, which is heavy work. Thus, Apache Doris 1.2.0 introduced the Multi-Catalog functionality. With this, you can map to external data at the catalog level, which means:\\n\\n1. You can map to the whole external data source and ingest all metadata from it.\\n2. You can manage the properties of the specified data source at the catalog level, such as connection, privileges, and data ingestion details, and easily handle multiple data sources.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Lakehouse/Lakehouse_2.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nData in Doris falls into two types of catalogs:\\n\\n1. Internal Catalog: Existing Doris databases and tables all belong to the Internal Catalog.\\n2. External Catalog: This is used to interface with external data sources. For example, HMS External Catalog can be connected to a cluster managed by Hive Metastore, and Iceberg External Catalog can be connected to an Iceberg cluster.\\n\\nYou can use the `SWITCH` statement to switch catalogs. You can also conduct federated queries using fully qualified names. For example:\\n\\n```\\nSELECT * FROM hive.db1.tbl1 a JOIN iceberg.db2.tbl2 b\\nON a.k1 = b.k1;\\n```\\n\\nSee more details [here](https://doris.apache.org/docs/dev/lakehouse/multi-catalog/).\\n\\n#### **Extensible Metadata Connection Framework**\\n\\nThe introduction of the catalog level also enables users to add new data sources simply by using the `CREATE CATALOG` statement:\\n\\n```\\nCREATE CATALOG hive PROPERTIES (\\n    \'type\'=\'hms\',\\n    \'hive.metastore.uris\' = \'thrift://172.21.0.1:7004\',\\n);\\n```\\n\\nIn data lake scenarios, Apache Doris currently supports the following metadata services:\\n\\n- Hive Metastore-compatible metadata services\\n- Alibaba Cloud Data Lake Formation\\n- AWS Glue\\n\\nThis also paves the way for developers who want to connect to more data sources via External Catalog. All they need is to implement the access interface.\\n\\n#### **Efficient Metadata Access**\\n\\nAccess to external data sources is often hindered by network conditions and data resources. This requires extra efforts of a data query engine to guarantee reliability, stability, and real-timeliness in metadata access.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Lakehouse/Lakehouse_3.png)\\n\\nDoris enables high efficiency in metadata access by **Meta Cache**, which includes Schema Cache, Partition Cache, and File Cache. This means that Doris can respond to metadata queries on thousands of tables in milliseconds. In addition, Doris supports manual refresh of metadata at the Catalog/Database/Table level. Meanwhile, it enables auto synchronization of metadata in Hive Metastore by monitoring Hive Metastore Event, so any changes can be updated within seconds.\\n\\n#### **Custom Authorization**\\n\\nExternal data sources usually come with their own privilege management services. Many companies use one single tool (such as Apache Ranger) to provide authorization for their multiple data systems. Doris supports a custom authorization plugin, which can be connected to the user\'s own privilege management system via the Doris Access Controller interface. As a user, you only need to specify the authorization plugin for a newly created catalog, and then you can readily perform authorization, audit, and data encryption on external data in Doris.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Lakehouse/Lakehouse_4.png)\\n\\n### Data Access\\n\\nDoris supports data access to external storage systems, including HDFS and S3-compatible object storage:\\n\\n![](../static/images/Lakehouse/Lakehouse_5.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Query Performance Optimization\\n\\nAfter clearing the way for external data access, the next step for a query engine would be to accelerate data queries. In the case of Apache Doris, efforts are made in data reading, execution engine, and optimizer.\\n\\n### **Data Reading**\\n\\nReading data on remote storage systems is often bottlenecked by access latency, concurrency, and I/O bandwidth, so reducing reading frequency will be a better choice.\\n\\n#### **Native File Format Reader**\\n\\nImproving data reading efficiency entails optimizing the reading of Parquet files and ORC files, which are the most commonly seen data files. Doris has refactored its File Reader, which is fine-tuned for each data format. Take the Native Parquet Reader as an example:\\n\\n- **Reduce format conversion**: It can directly convert files to the Doris storage format or to a format of higher performance using dictionary encoding. \\n- **Smart indexing of finer granularity**: It supports Page Index for Parquet files, so it can utilize Page-level smart indexing to filter Pages. \\n- **Predicate pushdown and late materialization**: It first reads columns with filters first and then reads the other columns of the filtered rows. This remarkably reduces file read volume since it avoids reading irrelevant data.\\n- **Lower read frequency**: Building on the high throughput and low concurrency of remote storage, it combines multiple data reads into one in order to improve overall data reading efficiency.\\n\\n#### File Cache\\n\\nDoris caches files from remote storage in local high-performance disks as a way to reduce overhead and increase performance in data reading. In addition, it has developed two new features that make queries on remote files as quick as those on local files:\\n\\n1. **Block cache**: Doris supports the block cache of remote files and can automatically adjust the block size from 4KB to 4MB based on the read request. The block cache method reduces read/write amplification and read latency in cold caches.\\n2. **Consistent hashing for caching**: Doris applies consistent hashing to manage cache locations and schedule data scanning. By doing so, it prevents cache failures brought about by the online and offlining of nodes. It can also increase cache hit rate and query service stability.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Lakehouse/Lakehouse_6.png)\\n\\n#### Execution Engine\\n\\nDevelopers surely don\'t want to rebuild all the general features for every new data source. Instead, they hope to reuse the vectorized execution engine and all operators in Doris in the data lakehouse scenario. Thus, Doris has refactored the scan nodes:\\n\\n- **Layer the logic**: All data queries in Doris, including those on internal tables, use the same operators, such as Join, Sort, and Agg. The only difference between queries on internal and external data lies in data access. In Doris, anything above the scan nodes follows the same query logic, while below the scan nodes, the implementation classes will take care of access to different data sources.\\n- **Use a general framework for scan operators**: Even for the scan nodes, different data sources have a lot in common, such as task splitting logic, scheduling of sub-tasks and I/O, predicate pushdown, and Runtime Filter. Therefore, Doris uses interfaces to handle them. Then, it implements a unified scheduling logic for all sub-tasks. The scheduler is in charge of all scanning tasks in the node. With global information of the node in hand, the schedular is able to do fine-grained management. Such a general framework makes it easy to connect a new data source to Doris, which will only take a week of work for one developer.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Lakehouse/Lakehouse_7.png)\\n\\n#### Query Optimizer\\n\\nDoris supports a range of statistical information from various data sources, including Hive Metastore, Iceberg Metafile, and Hudi MetaTable. It has also refined its cost model inference based on the characteristics of different data sources to enhance its query planning capability. \\n\\n#### Performance\\n\\nWe tested Doris and Presto/Trino on HDFS in flat table scenarios (ClickBench) and multi-table scenarios (TPC-H). Here are the results:\\n\\n![](../static/images/Lakehouse/Lakehouse_8.png)\\n\\n![](../static/images/Lakehouse/Lakehouse_9.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nAs is shown, with the same computing resources and on the same dataset, Apache Doris takes much less time to respond to SQL queries in both scenarios, delivering a 3~10 times higher performance than Presto/Trino.\\n\\n## Workload Management and Elastic Computing\\n\\nQuerying external data sources requires no internal storage of Doris. This makes elastic stateless computing nodes possible. Apache Doris 2.0 is going to implement Elastic Compute Node, which is dedicated to supporting query workloads of external data sources.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Lakehouse/Lakehouse_10.png)\\n\\nStateless computing nodes are open for quick scaling so users can easily cope with query workloads during peaks and valleys and strike a balance between performance and cost. In addition, Doris has optimized itself for Kubernetes cluster management and node scheduling. Now Master nodes can automatically manage the onlining and offlining of Elastic Compute Nodes, so users can govern their cluster workloads in cloud-native and hybrid cloud scenarios without difficulty.\\n\\n## Use Case\\n\\nApache Doris has been adopted by a financial institution for risk management. The user\'s high demands for data timeliness makes their data mart built on Greenplum and CDH, which could only process data from one day ago, no longer a great fit. In 2022, they incorporated Apache Doris in their data production and application pipeline, which allowed them to perform federated queries across Elasticsearch, Greenplum, and Hive. A few highlights from the user\'s feedback include:\\n\\n- Doris allows them to create one Hive Catalog that maps to tens of thousands of external Hive tables and conducts fast queries on them.\\n- Doris makes it possible to perform real-time federated queries using Elasticsearch Catalog and achieve a response time of mere milliseconds.\\n- Doris enables the decoupling of daily batch processing and statistical analysis, bringing less resource consumption and higher system stability.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Lakehouse/Lakehouse_11.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n# Future Plans\\n\\nApache Doris is going to support a wider range of data sources, improve its data reading and write-back functionality, and optimizes its resource isolation and scheduling.\\n\\n## More Data Sources\\n\\nWe are working closely with various open source communities to expand and improve Doris\' features in data lake analytics. We plan to provide:\\n\\n- Support for Incremental Query of Hudi Merge-on-Read tables;\\n- Lower query latency utilizing the indexing of Iceberg/Hudi in combination with the query optimizer;\\n- Support for more data lake formats such as Delta Lake and Flink Table Store.\\n\\n## Data Integration\\n\\n **Data reading:**\\n\\nApache Doris is going to:\\n\\n- Support CDC and Incremental Materialized Views for data lakes in order to provide users with near real-time data views;\\n- Support a Git-Like data access mode and enable easier and safer data management via the multi-version and Branch mechanisms. \\n\\n**Data Write-Back:**\\n\\nWe are going to enhance Apache Doris\' data analysis gateway. In the future, users will be able to use Doris as a unified data management portal that is in charge of the write-back of processed data, export of data, and the generation of a unified data view.\\n\\n## Resource Isolation & Scheduling\\n\\nApache Doris is undertaking a wider variety of workloads as it is interfacing with more and more data sources. For example, it needs to provide low-latency online services while batch processing T-1 data in Hive. To make it work, resource isolation within the same cluster is critical, which is where efforts will be made.\\n\\nMeanwhile, we will continue optimizing the scheduling logic of elastic computing nodes in various scenarios and develop intra-node resource isolation at a finer granularity, such as CPU, I/O, and memory. \\n\\n## Join us\\n\\nContact dev@apache.doris.org to join the Lakehouse SIG(Special Interest Group) in the Apache Doris community and talk to developers from all walks of life.\\n\\n**# Links:**\\n\\n**SelectDB:**\\n\\nhttps://selectdb.com \\n\\n**Apache Doris:**\\n\\nhttp://doris.apache.org\\n\\n**Apache Doris Github:**\\n\\nhttps://github.com/apache/doris"},{"id":"/Tencent Music","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Tencent Music","source":"@site/blog/Tencent Music.md","title":"Tencent Data Engineer: Why We Go from ClickHouse to Apache Doris?","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2023-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 7, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Best Practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/best-practice"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang & Kai Dai"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Tencent Data Engineer: Why We Go from ClickHouse to Apache Doris?","summary":"Evolution of the data processing architecture of Tencent Music Entertainment towards better performance and simpler maintenance.","date":"2023-03-07","author":"Jun Zhang & Kai Dai","tags":["Best Practice"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Building the Next-Generation Data Lakehouse: 10X Performance","permalink":"/blog/Data Lakehouse"},"nextItem":{"title":"Best Practice in Duyansoft, Improving Query Speed to Make the Most out of Your Data","permalink":"/blog/Duyansoft"}},"content":"\x3c!--\\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\\nor more contributor license agreements.

We are both data platform engineers at Tencent Music (NYSE: TME), a music streaming service provider with a whopping 800 million monthly active users. To drop the number here is not to brag but to give a hint of the sea of data that my poor coworkers and I have to deal with everyday.\\n\\n# What We Use ClickHouse For?\\n\\nThe music library of Tencent Music contains data of all forms and types: recorded music, live music, audios, videos, etc. As data platform engineers, our job is to distill information from the data, based on which our teammates can make better decisions to support our users and musical partners.\\n\\nSpecifically, we do all-round analysis of the songs, lyrics, melodies, albums, and artists, turn all this information into data assets, and pass them to our internal data users for inventory counting, user profiling, metrics analysis, and group targeting.\\n\\n![](../static/images/TME/TME_1.png)\\n\\nWe stored and processed most of our data in Tencent Data Warehouse (TDW), an offline data platform where we put the data into various tag and metric systems and then created flat tables centering each object (songs, artists, etc.).\\n\\nThen we imported the flat tables into ClickHouse for analysis and Elasticsearch for data searching and group targeting.\\n\\nAfter that, our data analysts used the data under the tags and metrics they needed to form datasets for different usage scenarios, during which they could create their own tags and metrics.\\n\\nThe data processing pipeline looked like this:\\n\\n![](../static/images/TME/TME_2.png)\\n\\n# The Problems with ClickHouse\\n\\nWhen working with the above pipeline, we encountered a few difficulties:\\n\\n1. **Partial Update**: Partial update of columns was not supported. Therefore, any latency from any one of the data sources could delay the creation of flat tables, and thus undermine data timeliness.\\n2. **High storage cost**: Data under different tags and metrics was updated at different frequencies. As much as ClickHouse excelled in dealing with flat tables, it was a huge waste of storage resources to just pour all data into a flat table and partition it by day, not to mention the maintenance cost coming with it.\\n3. **High maintenance cost**: Architecturally speaking, ClickHouse was characterized by the strong coupling of storage nodes and compute nodes. Its components were heavily interdependent, adding to the risks of cluster instability. Plus, for federated queries across ClickHouse and Elasticsearch, we had to take care of a huge amount of connection issues. That was just tedious.\\n\\n# Transition to Apache Doris\\n\\n[Apache Doris](https://github.com/apache/doris), a real-time analytical database, boasts a few features that are exactly what we needed in solving our problems:\\n\\n1. **Partial update**: Doris supports a wide variety of data models, among which the Aggregate Model supports real-time partial update of columns. Building on this, we can directly ingest raw data into Doris and create flat tables there. The ingestion goes like this: Firstly, we use Spark to load data into Kafka; then, any incremental data will be updated to Doris and Elasticsearch via Flink. Meanwhile, Flink will pre-aggregate the data so as to release burden on Doris and Elasticsearch.\\n2. **Storage cost**: Doris supports multi-table join queries and federated queries across Hive, Iceberg, Hudi, MySQL, and Elasticsearch. This allows us to split the large flat tables into smaller ones and partition them by update frequency. The benefits of doing so include a relief of storage burden and an increase of query throughput.\\n3. **Maintenance cost**: Doris is of simple architecture and is compatible with MySQL protocol. Deploying Doris only involves two processes (FE and BE) with no dependency on other systems, making it easy to operate and maintain. Also, Doris supports querying external ES data tables. It can easily interface with the metadata in ES and automatically map the table schema from ES so we can conduct queries on Elasticsearch data via Doris without grappling with complex connections.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s more, Doris supports multiple data ingestion methods, including batch import from remote storage such as HDFS and S3, data reads from MySQL binlog and Kafka, and real-time data synchronization or batch import from MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. It ensures service availability and data reliability through a consistency protocol and is capable of auto debugging. This is great news for our operators and maintainers.\\n\\nStatistically speaking, these features have cut our storage cost by 42% and development cost by 40%.\\n\\nDuring our usage of Doris, we have received lots of support from the open source Apache Doris community and timely help from the SelectDB team, which is now running a commercial version of Apache Doris.\\n\\n![](../static/images/TME/TME_3.png)\\n\\n# Further Improvement to Serve Our Needs\\n\\n## Introduce a Semantic Layer\\n\\nSpeaking of the datasets, on the bright side, our data analysts are given the liberty of redefining and combining the tags and metrics at their convenience. But on the dark side, high heterogeneity of the tag and metric systems leads to more difficulty in their usage and management.\\n\\nOur solution is to introduce a semantic layer in our data processing pipeline. The semantic layer is where all the technical terms are translated into more comprehensible concepts for our internal data users. In other words, we are turning the tags and metrics into first-class citizens for data definement and management.\\n\\n![](../static/images/TME/TME_4.png)\\n\\n**Why would this help?**\\n\\nFor data analysts, all tags and metrics will be created and shared at the semantic layer so there will be less confusion and higher efficiency.\\n\\nFor data users, they no longer need to create their own datasets or figure out which one is applicable for each scenario but can simply conduct queries on their specified tagset and metricset.\\n\\n## Upgrade the Semantic Layer\\n\\nExplicitly defining the tags and metrics at the semantic layer was not enough. In order to build a standardized data processing system, our next goal was to ensure consistent definition of tags and metrics throughout the whole data processing pipeline.\\n\\nFor this sake, we made the semantic layer the heart of our data management system:\\n\\n![](../static/images/TME/TME_5.png)\\n\\n**How does it work?**\\n\\nAll computing logics in TDW will be defined at the semantic layer in the form of a single tag or metric.\\n\\nThe semantic layer receives logic queries from the application side, selects an engine accordingly, and generates SQL. Then it sends the SQL command to TDW for execution. Meanwhile, it might also send configuration and data ingestion tasks to Doris and decide which metrics and tags should be accelerated.\\n\\nIn this way, we have made the tags and metrics more manageable. A fly in the ointment is that since each tag and metric is individually defined, we are struggling with automating the generation of a valid SQL statement for the queries. If you have any idea about this, you are more than welcome to talk to us.\\n\\n# Give Full Play to Apache Doris\\n\\nAs you can see, Apache Doris has played a pivotal role in our solution. Optimizing the usage of Doris can largely improve our overall data processing efficiency. So in this part, we are going to share with you what we do with Doris to accelerate data ingestion and queries and reduce costs.\\n\\n## What We Want?\\n\\n![](../static/images/TME/TME_6.png)\\n\\nCurrently, we have 800+ tags and 1300+ metrics derived from the 80+ source tables in TDW.\\n\\nWhen importing data from TDW to Doris, we hope to achieve:\\n\\n- **Real-time availability:** In addition to the traditional T+1 offline data ingestion, we require real-time tagging.\\n- **Partial update**: Each source table generates data through its own ETL task at various paces and involves only part of the tags and metrics, so we require the support for partial update of columns.\\n- **High performance**: We need a response time of only a few seconds in group targeting, analysis and reporting scenarios.\\n- **Low costs**: We hope to reduce costs as much as possible.\\n\\n## What We Do?\\n\\n1. **Generate Flat Tables in Flink Instead of TDW**\\n\\n![](../static/images/TME/TME_7.png)\\n\\nGenerating flat tables in TDW has a few downsides:\\n\\n- **High storage cost**: TDW has to maintain an extra flat table apart from the discrete 80+ source tables. That\u2019s huge redundancy.\\n- **Low real-timeliness**: Any delay in the source tables will be augmented and retard the whole data link.\\n- **High development cost**: To achieve real-timeliness would require extra development efforts and resources.\\n\\nOn the contrary, generating flat tables in Doris is much easier and less expensive. The process is as follows:\\n\\n- Use Spark to import new data into Kafka in an offline manner.\\n- Use Flink to consume Kafka data.\\n- Create a flat table via the primary key ID.\\n- Import the flat table into Doris.\\n\\nAs is shown below, Flink has aggregated the five lines of data, of which \u201cID\u201d=1, into one line in Doris, reducing the data writing pressure on Doris.\\n\\n![](../static/images/TME/TME_8.png)\\n\\nThis can largely reduce storage costs since TDW no long has to maintain two copies of data and KafKa only needs to store the new data pending for ingestion. What\u2019s more, we can add whatever ETL logic we want into Flink and reuse lots of development logic for offline and real-time data ingestion.\\n\\n**2. Name the Columns Smartly**\\n\\nAs we mentioned, the Aggregate Model of Doris allows partial update of columns. Here we provide a simple introduction to other data models in Doris for your reference:\\n\\n**Unique Model**: This is applicable for scenarios requiring primary key uniqueness. It only keeps the latest data of the same primary key ID. (As far as we know, the Apache Doris community is planning to include partial update of columns in the Unique Model, too.)\\n\\n**Duplicate Model**: This model stores all original data exactly as it is without any pre-aggregation or deduplication.\\n\\nAfter determining the data model, we had to think about how to name the columns. Using the tags or metrics as column names was not a choice because:\\n\\nI. Our internal data users might need to rename the metrics or tags, but Doris 1.1.3 does not support modification of column names.\\n\\nII. Tags might be taken online and offline frequently. If that involves the adding and dropping of columns, it will be not only time-consuming but also detrimental to query performance.\\n\\nInstead, we do the following:\\n\\n- **For flexible renaming of tags and metrics**, we use MySQL tables to store the metadata (name, globally unique ID, status, etc.). Any change to the names will only happen in the metadata but will not affect the table schema in Doris. For example, if a `song_name` is given an ID of 4, it will be stored with the column name of a4 in Doris. Then if the `song_name`is involved in a query, it will be converted to a4 in SQL.\\n- **For the onlining and offlining of tags**, we sort out the tags based on how frequently they are being used. The least used ones will be given an offline mark in their metadata. No new data will be put under the offline tags but the existing data under those tags will still be available.\\n- **For real-time availability of newly added tags and metrics**, we prebuild a few ID columns in Doris tables based on the mapping of name IDs. These reserved ID columns will be allocated to the newly added tags and metrics. Thus, we can avoid table schema change and the consequent overheads. Our experience shows that only 10 minutes after the tags and metrics are added, the data under them can be available.\\n\\nNoteworthily, the recently released Doris 1.2.0 supports Light Schema Change, which means that to add or remove columns, you only need to modify the metadata in FE. Also, you can rename the columns in data tables as long as you have enabled Light Schema Change for the tables. This is a big trouble saver for us.\\n\\n**3. Optimize Date Writing**\\n\\nHere are a few practices that have reduced our daily offline data ingestion time by 75% and our CUMU compaction score from 600+ to 100.\\n\\n- Flink pre-aggregation: as is mentioned above.\\n- Auto-sizing of writing batch: To reduce Flink resource usage, we enable the data in one Kafka Topic to be written into various Doris tables and realize the automatic alteration of batch size based on the data amount.\\n- Optimization of Doris data writing: fine-tune the the sizes of tablets and buckets as well as the compaction parameters for each scenario:\\n\\n```\\nmax_XXXX_compaction_thread\\nmax_cumulative_compaction_num_singleton_deltas\\n```\\n\\n- Optimization of the BE commit logic: conduct regular caching of BE lists, commit them to the BE nodes batch by batch, and use finer load balancing granularity.\\n\\n![](../static/images/TME/TME_9.png)\\n\\n**4. Use Dori-on-ES in Queries**\\n\\nAbout 60% of our data queries involve group targeting. Group targeting is to find our target data by using a set of tags as filters. It poses a few requirements for our data processing architecture:\\n\\n- Group targeting related to APP users can involve very complicated logic. That means the system must support hundreds of tags as filters simultaneously.\\n- Most group targeting scenarios only require the latest tag data. However, metric queries need to support historical data.\\n- Data users might need to perform further aggregated analysis of metric data after group targeting.\\n- Data users might also need to perform detailed queries on tags and metrics after group targeting.\\n\\nAfter consideration, we decided to adopt Doris-on-ES. Doris is where we store the metric data for each scenario as a partition table, while Elasticsearch stores all tag data. The Doris-on-ES solution combines the distributed query planning capability of Doris and the full-text search capability of Elasticsearch. The query pattern is as follows:\\n\\n```\\nSELECT tag, agg(metric) \\n   FROM Doris \\n   WHERE id in (select id from Es where tagFilter)\\n   GROUP BY tag\\n```\\n\\nAs is shown, the ID data located in Elasticsearch will be used in the sub-query in Doris for metric analysis.\\n\\nIn practice, we find that the query response time is related to the size of the target group. If the target group contains over one million objects, the query will take up to 60 seconds. If it is even larger, a timeout error might occur.\\n\\nAfter investigation, we identified our two biggest time wasters:\\n\\nI. When Doris BE pulls data from Elasticsearch (1024 lines at a time by default), for a target group of over one million objects, the network I/O overhead can be huge.\\n\\nII. After the data pulling, Doris BE needs to conduct Join operations with local metric tables via SHUFFLE/BROADCAST, which can cost a lot.\\n\\n![](../static/images/TME/TME_10.png)\\n\\nThus, we make the following optimizations:\\n\\n- Add a query session variable `es_optimize` that specifies whether to enable optimization.\\n- In data writing into ES, add a BK column to store the bucket number after the primary key ID is hashed. The algorithm is the same as the bucketing algorithm in Doris (CRC32).\\n- Use Doris BE to generate a Bucket Join execution plan, dispatch the bucket number to BE ScanNode and push it down to ES.\\n- Use ES to compress the queried data; turn multiple data fetch into one and reduce network I/O overhead.\\n- Make sure that Doris BE only pulls the data of buckets related to the local metric tables and conducts local Join operations directly to avoid data shuffling between Doris BEs.\\n\\n![](../static/images/TME/TME_11.png)\\n\\nAs a result, we reduce the query response time for large group targeting from 60 seconds to a surprising 3.7 seconds.\\n\\nCommunity information shows that Doris is going to support inverted indexing since version 2.0.0, which is soon to be released. With this new version, we will be able to conduct full-text search on text types, equivalence or range filtering of texts, numbers, and datetime, and conveniently combine AND, OR, NOT logic in filtering since the inverted indexing supports array types. This new feature of Doris is expected to deliver 3~5 times better performance than Elasticsearch on the same task.\\n\\n**5. Refine the Management of Data**\\n\\nDoris\u2019 capability of cold and hot data separation provides the foundation of our cost reduction strategies in data processing.\\n\\n- Based on the TTL mechanism of Doris, we only store data of the current year in Doris and put the historical data before that in TDW for lower storage cost.\\n- We vary the numbers of copies for different data partitions. For example, we set three copies for data of the recent three months, which is used frequently, one copy for data older than six months, and two copies for data in between.\\n- Doris supports turning hot data into cold data so we only store data of the past seven days in SSD and transfer data older than that to HDD for less expensive storage.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThank you for scrolling all the way down here and finishing this long read. We\u2019ve shared our cheers and tears, lessons learned, and a few practices that might be of some value to you during our transition from ClickHouse to Doris. We really appreciate the help from the Apache Doris community and the [SelectDB](https://selectdb.com) team, but we might still be chasing them around for a while since we attempt to realize auto-identification of cold and hot data, pre-computation of frequently used tags/metrics, simplification of code logic using Materialized Views, and so on and so forth.\\n\\n\\n\\n**# Links**\\n\\n**SelectDB**:\\n\\nhttps://selectdb.com \\n\\n**Apache Doris**:\\n\\nhttp://doris.apache.org\\n\\n**Apache Doris Github**:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/apache/doris"},{"id":"/Duyansoft","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Duyansoft","source":"@site/blog/Duyansoft.md","title":"Best Practice in Duyansoft, Improving Query Speed to Make the Most out of Your Data","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2023-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 27, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Best Practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/best-practice"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Junfei Liu"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Best Practice in Duyansoft, Improving Query Speed to Make the Most out of Your Data","summary":"This is about how Duyansoft improved its overall data processing efficiency by optimizing the choice and usage of data warehouses.","date":"2023-02-27","author":"Junfei Liu","tags":["Best Practice"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Tencent Data Engineer: Why We Go from ClickHouse to Apache Doris?","permalink":"/blog/Tencent Music"},"nextItem":{"title":"ClickHouse & Kudu to Doris: 10X Concurrency Increased, 70% Latency Down","permalink":"/blog/linkedcare"}},"content":"\x3c!-- \\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\\nor more contributor license agreements.

However, in today\u2019s era, what\u2019s more important than the data itself is the ability to locate your wanted information among all the overflowing data quickly. So in this article, I will talk about how I improved overall data processing efficiency by optimizing the choice and usage of data warehouses.\\n\\n# Too Much Data on My Plate\\n\\nThe choice of data warehouses was never high on my worry list until 2021. I have been working as a data engineer for a Fintech SaaS provider since its incorporation in 2014. In the company\u2019s infancy, we didn\u2019t have too much data to juggle. We only needed a simple tool for OLTP and business reporting, and the traditional databases would cut the mustard.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Duyansoft/Duyan_1.png)\\n\\nBut as the company grew, the data we received became overwhelmingly large in volume and increasingly diversified in sources. Every day, we had tons of user accounts logging in and sending myriads of requests. It was like collecting water from a thousand taps to put out a million scattered pieces of fire in a building, except that you must bring the exact amount of water needed for each fire spot. Also, we got more and more emails from our colleagues asking if we could make data analysis easier for them. That\u2019s when the company assembled a big data team to tackle the beast.\\n\\nThe first thing we did was to revolutionize our data processing architecture. We used DataHub to collect all our transactional or log data and ingest it into an offline data warehouse for data processing (analyzing, computing. etc.). Then the results would be exported to MySQL and then forwarded to QuickBI to display the reports visually. We also replaced MongoDB with a real-time data warehouse for business queries.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Duyansoft/Duyan_2.png)\\n\\nThis new architecture worked, but there remained a few pebbles in our shoes:\\n\\n- **We wanted faster responses.** MySQL could be slow in aggregating large tables, but our product guys requested a query response time of fewer than five seconds. So first, we tried to optimize MySQL. Then we also tried to skip MySQL and directly connect the offline data warehouse with QuickBI, hoping that the combination of query acceleration capability of the former and caching of the latter would do the magic. Still, that five-second goal seemed to be unreachable. There was a time when I believed the only perfect solution was for the product team to hire people with more patience.\\n- **We wanted less pain in maintaining dimension tables.** The offline data warehouse conducted data synchronization every five minutes, making it not applicable for frequent data updates or deletions scenarios. If we needed to maintain dimension tables in it, we would have to filter and deduplicate the data regularly to ensure data consistency. Out of our trouble-averse instinct, we chose not to do so.\\n- **We wanted support for point queries of high concurrency.** The real-time database that we previously used required up to 500ms to respond to highly concurrent point queries in both columnar storage and row storage, even after optimization. That was not good enough.\\n\\n# Hit It Where It Hurts Most\\n\\nIn March, 2022, we started our hunt for a better data warehouse. To our disappointment, there was no one-size-fits-all solution. Most of the tools we looked into were only good at one or a few of the tasks, but if we gathered the best performer for each usage scenario, that would add up to a heavy and messy toolkit, which was against instinct.\\n\\nSo we decided to solve our biggest headache first: slow response, as it was hurting both the experience of our users and our internal work efficiency.\\n\\nTo begin with, we tried to move the largest tables from MySQL to [Apache Doris](https://github.com/apache/doris), a real-time analytical database that supports MySQL protocol. That reduced the query execution time by a factor of eight. Then we tried and used Doris to accommodate more data.\\n\\nAs for now, we are using two Doris clusters: one to handle point queries (high QPS) from our users and the other for internal ad-hoc queries and reporting. As a result, users have reported smoother experience and we can provide more features that are used to be bottlenecked by slow query execution. Moving our dimension tables to Doris also brought less data errors and higher development efficiency.\\n\\n![](../static/images/Duyansoft/Duyan_3.png)\\n\\nBoth the FE and BE processes of Doris can be scaled out, so tens of PBs of data stored in hundreds of devices can be put into one single cluster. In addition, the two types of processes implement a consistency protocol to ensure service availability and data reliability. This removes dependency on Hadoop and thus saves us the cost of deploying Hadoop clusters.\\n\\n# Tips\\n\\nHere are a few of our practices to share with you:\\n\\n## **Data Model:**\\n\\nOut of the three Doris data models, we find the Unique Model and the Aggregate Model suit our needs most. For example, we use the Unique Model to ensure data consistency while ingesting dimension tables and original tables and the Aggregate Model to import report data.\\n\\n## **Data Ingestion:**\\n\\nFor real-time data ingestion, we use the Flink-Doris-Connector: After our business data, the MySQL-based binlogs, is written into Kafka, it will be parsed by Flink and then loaded into Doris in a real-time manner.\\n\\nFor offline data ingestion, we use DataX: This mainly involves the computed report data in our offline data warehouse.\\n\\n## **Data Management:**\\n\\nWe back up our cluster data in a remote storage system via Broker. Then, it can restore the data from the backups to any Doris cluster if needed via the restore command.\\n\\n## **Monitoring and Alerting:**\\n\\nIn addition to the various monitoring metrics of Doris, we deployed an audit log plugin to keep a closer eye on certain slow SQL of certain users for optimization.\\n\\nSlow SQL queries:\\n\\n![](../static/images/Duyansoft/Duyan_4.png)\\n\\nSome of our often-used monitoring metrics:\\n\\n![](../static/images/Duyansoft/Duyan_5.png)\\n\\n**Tradeoff Between Resource Usage and Real-Time Availability:**\\n\\nIt turned out that using Flink-Doris-Connector for data ingestion can result in high cluster resource usage, so we increased the interval between each data writing from 3s to 10 or 20s, compromising a little bit on the real-time availability of data in exchange for much less resource usage.\\n\\n# Communication with Developers\\n\\nWe have been in close contact with the open source Doris community all the way from our investigation to our adoption of the data warehouse, and we\u2019ve provided a few suggestions to the developers:\\n\\n- Enable Flink-Doris-Connector to support simultaneous writing of multiple tables in a single sink.\\n- Enable Materialized Views to support Join of multiple tables.\\n- Optimize the underlying compaction of data and reduce resource usage as much as possible.\\n- Provide optimization suggestions for slow SQL and warnings for abnormal table creation behaviors.\\n\\nIf the perfect data warehouse is not there to be found, I think providing feedback for the second best is a way to help make one. We are also looking into its commercialized version called SelectDB to see if more custom-tailored advanced features can grease the wheels.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nAs we set out to find a single data warehouse that could serve all our needs, we ended up finding something less than perfect but good enough to improve our query speed by a wide margin and discovered some surprising features of it along the way.

In 2021, it was selected as one of the top 150 digital healthcare companies in the world by CB Insights. Linkedcare has served thousands of plastic surgery institutions in Los Angeles, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Linkedcare also provides integrated management system services for dental clinics, covering electronic medical records, customer relationship management, intelligent marketing, B2B trading platform, insurance payment, BI tools, etc.\\n\\n# Doris\' Evolution in Linkedcare\\nLet me briefly introduce Doris\'s development in Linkedcare first. In general, the application of Doris in Linkedcare can be divided into two stages:\\n1. The value-added report provided by Linkedcare to customers was initially provided by ClickHouse, which was later replaced by Apache Doris;\\n2. Due to the continuous improvement of real-time data analysis requirements, T+1\'s data reporting gradually cannot meet business needs. Linkedcare needs a data warehouse that can handle real-time processing, and Doris has been introduced into the company\'s data warehouse since then. With the support of the Apache Doris community and the SelectDB professional technical team, our business data has been gradually migrated from Kudu to Doris.\\n\\n![1](/images/linkedcare/1.png)\\n\\n# Data Service Architecture: From ClickHouse to Doris\\n## Data Service Architecture Requirements\\n- Support complex queries: When customers do self-service on the dashboard, a complex SQL query statement will be generated to directly query the database, and the complexity of the statement is unknown, which adds a lot of pressure on the database and affects query performance.\\n- High concurrency and low latency: At least 100 concurrent queries can be supported, and query results can be return within 1 second;\\n- Real-time data update: The report data comes from the SaaS system. When the customer modifies the historical data in the system, the report data must be changed accordingly to ensure consistentency, which requires real-time processing.\\n- Low cost and easy deployment: There are a lot of private cloud customers in our SaaS business. In order to reduce labor costs, the business requires that the architecture deployment and operation and maintenance be simple enough.\\n\\n## Early Problems Found: ClickHouse Shuts Down When High-concurrency Occurs\\nThe previous project chose ClickHouse to provide data query services, but serious concurrency problems occurred during use:\\n10 concurrent queries will cause ClickHouse to shut down, resulting in the inability to provide services to customers normally, which is the direct reason for us to replace ClickHouse.\\n\\nIn addition, there are several severe problems:\\n1. The cost of ClickHouse services on the cloud is very high, and the dependency on ClickHouse components is relatively high. The frequent interaction between ClickHouse and Zookeeper during data ingestion will put greater pressure on stability.\\n2. How to seamlessly migrate data without affecting the normal use of customers is another problem.\\n\\n## Selection between Doris, Clickhouse and Kudu\\nTo deal with the existing problems and meet the business requirements, we decided to conduct research on Doris (0.14), Clickhouse, and Kudu respectively.\\n\\n![2](/images/linkedcare/2.png)\\n\\nAs shown in the table above, we made a deep comparison of these 3 databases. And we can see that Doris has excellent performance in many aspects:\\n- High concurrency: Doris can handle high-concurrency of 1,000 and more. So it will easily solve the problem of 10 concurrent queries which led ClickHouse to shut down.\\n- Query performance: Doris can achieve millisecond-level query response. In single-table query, although Doris and ClickHouse are almost equivalent in query performance, in multi-table query, Doris is far better than ClickHouse. Doris can make sure that the QPS won\'t drop when high-concurrency happens.\\n- Data update: Doris\' data model can meet our needs for data update to ensure the consistency of system data and business data, which will be described in detail below.\\n- Ease of use: Doris has a flat architecture, simple and fast deployment, fully-completed data ingest functions, and good at scaling out; At the same time, Doris can automatically perform replica balancing internally, and the operation and maintenance cost is extremely low. However, ClickHouse and Kudu rely heavily on components and require a lot of preparatory work for use. This requires a professional team to handle a large number of daily operation and maintenance tasks.\\n- Standard SQL: Doris is compatible with the MySQL protocol and uses standard SQL. It is easy for developers to get started and does not require additional learning costs.\\n- Distributed JOINs: Doris supports distributed JOINs, but ClickHouse has limitations in JOIN queries and functions as well as poor maintainability.\\n- Active community: The Apache Doris open source community is active with passion. At the same time, SelectDB provides a professional and full-time team for technical support for the Doris community. If you encounter problems, you can directly contact the community and find out a solution in time.\\n\\nFrom the above research, we can find that Doris has excellent capabilities in all aspects and is very in line with our needs. Therefore, we adopt Doris instead of ClickHouse, which solves the problems of poor concurrency and the shutdown of ClickHouse.\\n\\n# Data Warehouse Architecture: From Kudu+Impala to Doris\\nIn the process of using data reports, we have gradually discovered many advantages of Doris, so we decided to introduce Doris to the company\'s data warehouse.\\n\\n## Data Warehouse Architecture Requirements\\n- When the customer modifies the historical data in the system, the report data should also be changed accordingly. At the same time, there should be a feature that can help customers to change the value of a single column;\\n- When Flink extracts the full amount of data from the business database and writes it into the data warehouse frequently, the version compaction must keep up with the speed of new version generation, and will not cause version accumulation;\\n- Through resource isolation and other functions, Doris reduces the possibility of resource preemption, improves resource utilization, and makes full use of resources on the core computing nodes;\\n- Due to the limited memory resources in the company, overloaded tasks must be completed without increasing the number of clusters.\\n\\n## Early Problems Found: Kudu+Impala Underperforms\\nThe early company data warehouse architecture used Kudu and Impala for computing and storage. But we found the following problems during use:\\n1. When the number of concurrent queries (QPS) is large, the simple query response time of Kudu+Impala is always more than a few seconds, which cannot reach the millisecond-level required by the business. The long waiting time has brought bad user experience to customers. \\n2. The Kudu+Impala engine cannot perform incremental aggregation of factual data, and can barely support real-time data analysis.\\n3. Kudu relies on a large number of primary key lookups when ingesting data. The batch processing efficiency is low and Kudu consumes a lot of CPU, which is not friendly to resource utilization.\\n\\n## New Data Warehouse Architecture Design Based on Doris\\n\\n![3](/images/linkedcare/3.png)\\n\\nAs shown in the figure above, Apache Doris is used in the new architecture and is responsible for data warehouse storage and computing; Data ingestion of real-time data and ODS data through Kafka has been replaced with Flink; We use Duckula as our stream computing platform; While we introduce DolphinSchedular for our task scheduling.\\n\\n# Benefits of the new architecture based on Apache Doris:\\n- The new data warehouse architecture based on Doris no longer depends on Hadoop related components, and the operation and maintenance cost is low.\\n- Higher performance. Doris uses less server resources but provides stronger data processing capabilities;\\n- Doris supports high concurrency and can directly support WebApp query services;\\n- Doris supports the access to external tables, which enable easy data publishing and data ingestion;\\n- Doris supports dynamic scaling out and automatic data balance;\\n- Doris supports multiple federated queries, including Hive, ES, MySQL, etc.;\\n- Doris\' Aggregate Model supports users updating a single column;\\n- By adjusting BE parameters and cluster size, the problem of version accumulation can be effectively solved;\\n- Through the Resource Tag and Query Block function, cluster resource isolation can be realized, resource usage rate can be reduced, and query performance can be improved.\\n\\nThanks to the excellent capabilities of the new architecture, the cluster we use has been reduced from 18 pieces of 16Cores 128G to 12 pieces of 16Cores 128G, saving up to 33% of resources compared to before; Further, the computing performance has been greatly improved. Doris can complete an ETL task that was completed in 3 hours on Kudu in only 1 hour. In addition, in frequent updates, Kudu\'s internal data fragmentation files cannot be automatically merged so that the performance will become worse and worse, requiring regular rebuilding; While the compaction function of Doris can effectively solve this problem.\\n\\n# Highly Recommended\\nThe cost of using Doris is very low. Only 3 low-end servers or even desktops can be used to deploy easily a data warehouse based on Apache Doris; For enterprises with limited investment and do not want to be left behind by the market, it is highly recommended to try Apache Doris.\\n\\nDoris is also a mature analytical database with MPP architecture. At the same time, its community is very active and easy to communicate with. SelectDB, the commercial company behind Doris, has set up a full-time technical team for the community. Any questions can be answered within 1 hour. In the last year, the community has been continuously promoted by SelectDB and introduced a series of industry-leading new features. In addition, the community will seriously consider the user habits when iterating, which will bring a lot of convenience.\\n\\nI really appreciate the full support from the Doris community and the SelectDB team. And I sincerely recommend developers and enterprises to start with Apache Doris today.\\n\\n# Apache Doris \\nApache Doris is a real-time analytical database based on MPP architecture, known for its high performance and ease of use.

In this lecture, you will go through the development of Doris in 2022 and look into the new trends that Doris is exploring in 2023. My name is Mingyu Chen and I am the PMC Chair of the Apache Doris. I have been developing for Doris since 2014, and witnessed its whole process from open-source to graduation from Apache. My sharing will cover the following aspects. Let\'s get started.\\n\\nAs the beginning, I will briefly introduce what Doris is and why we should choose Doris in case you are new to Apache Doris. In 2022, Doris has became one of the most active open-sourced big data analysis engine projects in the world while the Doris community became one of the most active open-source communities in China, which you may get interested in. Moreover, the cutting-edge features, such as vectorized execution engine, cloud-native and efficient semi-structured data analysis, real-time processing and Lakehouse will be the focus of my lecture today. Also, it is important to prioritize tasks at the beginning of the year, so I will go through our job list with you shortly.\\n\\n# About Doris\\n\\nBriefly speaking, Apache Doris is an easy-to-use, high-performance and unified analytical database. As shown in this enterprise data flow chart, you may have a clear vision of where Apache Doris stands. Data from various upstream data sources, such as transactional databases, log systems, event tracking, etc., as well as data from ETL components, such as Flink, Spark and Hive is ingested into Doris through data processing and integration tools. \\n\\n![flow](/images/summit/en/flow.png)\\n\\nAs a fully-complete database system, Doris can provide various direct query functions including report analysis, multi-dimensional analysis, log analysis, user portrait and lakehouse, etc. Thanks to Doris\' MPP SQL distributed query engine. Doris can also be used to query external data sources from Hive, Iceberg, Hudi, Elasticsearch and various transactional database systems connected through JDBC, without data import and maintaining the schema of other data sources. There are several core features that can help users solve practical problems, which are as follows:\\n\\n- NO.1 is the ease of use. It supports ANSI SQL syntax, including single table aggregation, sorting, filtering and multi table join, sub query, etc. It also supports complex SQL syntax such as window function and grouping sets. At the same time, users can expand system functions through UDF, UDAF. In addition, Apache Doris is also compatible with MySQL protocol, which allows users access Doris through various BI tools. \\n- NO.2 is high performance. Doris is equipped with an efficient column storage engine, which not only reduces the amount of data scanning, but also implements an ultra-high data compression ratio. At the same time, Doris also uses various index technology to speed up data reading and filtering. Using the partition and bucket pruning function, Doris can support ultra-high concurrency of online service business, and a single node can support up to thousands of QPS. Further, Apache Doris combines the vectorized execution engine to give full play to the modern CPU parallel computing power. Doris supports materialized view. In terms of the optimizer, Doris uses a combination of CBO and RBO, with RBO supporting constant folding, subquery rewriting, predicate pushdown, etc.\\n- NO.3 is unified data warehouse. Thanks to the well-designed architecture, Doris can easily handle both low-latency, high-concurrency scenarios and high-throughput scenarios . \\n- NO.4 is the federated query analysis. With the help of Doris\'s complete distributed query engine, Doris can access data lake such as Hive, Iceberg and Hudi, as well as high-speed queries to external data sources such as Elasticsearch and MySQL. \\n- NO.5 is ecological enrichment. Doris provides rich data ingest methods, supports fast loading of data from localhost, Hadoop, Flink, Spark, Kafka, SeaTunnel and other systems, and can also directly access data in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, S3, Hive, Iceberg, Elasticsearch and other systems without data replication. At the same time, the data stored in Doris can also be read by Spark and Flink, and can be output to the upstream data application for display and analysis.\\n\\nNext, we will review what remarkable achievements the Doris community has achieved in 2022.\\n\\n# How should we look back on 2022?\\n\\nIn 2022, the world has witnessed  unprecedented changes, and countless magical moments are happening in reality. Thankfully, the power of technology and open source has navigated us to the right path. And 2022 is absolutely a fruitful year for Apache Doris. Let\'s review the development of Apache Doris in the past year from several angles:\\n\\n## Important Indicators of the Community\\n![community](/images/summit/en/community.png)\\n\\nIn the past year:\\n- The number of cumulative community contributors has increased from 200 to nearly 420, a year-on-year increase of more than 100%, which is still rising.\\n- The number of monthly active contributors has doubled from 50 to 100.\\n- The number of GitHub Stars has increased from 3.6k to 6.8k, and has been on the daily/weekly/monthly  GitHub Trending list many times.\\n- The number of all Commits increased from 3.7k to 7.6k. The amount of newly submitted code in the past year exceeded the total of previous years.\\n\\n![community 2](/images/summit/en/community 2.png)\\n\\nFrom these data, we can see that in 2022, there was an explosive growth in Apache Doris. The data indicators of all dimensions are grown by nearly 100%. The great effort has also made Apache Doris one of the most active open-source communities in the big data and database world. As is the growth shown in the trending of GitHub Contribution above, users and developers have made tremendous contribution to the community .\\nIt is memorable that in June 2022, Apache Doris graduated from the Apache incubator and became a Top-Level Project, which is the biggest milestone since open-souced.\\n\\n![top level](/images/summit/en/top level.png)\\n\\n## Open Source User Scale\\n\\nThanks to the voluntary technical support from the developers of SelectDB, a commercial company funding Apache Doris. In 2022 Doris became smoother in user connection and communication, and we were able to interact with users more directly and listen to their real voices.\\nLast year, Apache Doris was applied in dozens of industries, such as the Internet, fintech, telecommunications, education, automobiles, manufacturing, logistics, energy, and government affairs, and especially in the Internet industry, which is known for massive data. 80% of the TOP 50 Chinese Internet companies have been using Apache Doris for a long time to solve data analysis problems in their own business, including Baidu, Meituan, Xiaomi, Tencent, JD.com, ByteDance , NetEase, Sina, 360 Total Security, MiHoYo, ZHIHU.COM, etc.\\n\\n![logo wall](/images/summit/en/logo wall.png)\\n\\nGlobally, Apache Doris has served thousands of enterprise users, and this number is still growing rapidly. Most enterprise users are glad to contact the community and participate in community building through various means. Moreover, many of the enterprise users participated in Doris Summit, giving a lecture of their own practical experience based on real business.\\n\\n## Releases\\n\\nIn the early versions, ease of use has been frequently emphasized. The versions released in 2022  mainly focus on performance, stability, ease of use, which is a comprehensive evolution.\\n- In April, the community released Apache Doris V1.0.0, whose major version first changed from 0 to 1(V0.1.5 to V1.0.0) since open-sourced. In version 1.0, the extraordinary vectorized execution engine was first published, marking the beginning of Apache Doris to the era of ultra-high speed data analysis.\\n- In version 1.1 released in June, we further improved and optimized the vectorized engine, and set it as default. Simultaneously, the community has also prepared LTS(Long-Term-Support) versions released to quickly fix bugs and optimize functions for version 1.1 on a monthly basis, aiming to ensure higher stability required by the growing community users.\\n- Launched in early December, Version 1.2 not only introduces many important functions, such as Merge-on-Write for Unique Key model, Multi-Catalog, Java UDF, Array type, JSONB type, etc., but also improves the query performance by nearly ten times. These features allow Apache Doris to be more adaptable and possible for more data analysis.\\n- In version 1.2, stability and quality assurance were strongly stressed. On the one hand, using automated testing tools such as SQL Smith and test cases from various well-known open source projects, we have built millions of test case sets; On the other hand, the community access pipeline and perfect regression testing framework ensure the quality of code-merge. \\n\\n## Evolution of Core Features\\n\\nIn 2022, the community\'s research and development was mainly focused on four aspects, high performance, real-time processing, semi-structured data support and Lakehouse.\\n\\n![2022](/images/summit/en/2022.png)\\n\\n- Query performance improvement. From the released version 1.0 to 1.2, Apache Doris has made remarkable achievement in performance. In the single-table test, Apache Doris won 3rd place in Clickbench database performance list launched by Clickhouse. In the multi-table association, thanks to the vectorized execution engine and various query optimization, compared to the released version 0.15 at the end of 2021, Apache Doris was 10 times faster in standard test data sets under SSB and TPC-H, which marks Apache Doris one of the best databases in the world!\\n\\n![performance](/images/summit/en/performance.png)\\n\\n- Real-time processing optimization. In version 1.2, we have implemented the Merge-On-Write data update method on the original Unique Key, with a query performance improved by 5-10 times during high-frequency updates and low latency on updateable data in real-time analytics. In addition, the lightweight Schema Change enables easier column adding and substraction of data, which is unecessary for users to convert historical data any more. Tools such as Flink CDC can be used instantly to synchronize DML or DDL operations in transaction databases, making data synchronization smoother and unified.\\n\\n![realtime](/images/summit/en/realtime.png)\\n\\n- Semi-structured data analysis. At present, Apache Doris supports Array and JSONB types. The Array type can not only store complex data structures, but also support user behavior analysis through Array functions. JSONB is a binary JSON storage type, which not only has 4 times faster access performance than Text JSON, but has lower memory consumption as well. Various log data structures in JSON format can be easily ingested through JSONB efficiently. \\n\\n![semi](/images/summit/en/semi.png)\\n\\n- Lakehouse. In version 1.2.0, through multiple performance optimizations for external data sources such as Native Format Reader, late materialization, asynchronous IO, data prefetching, high-performance execution engine and query optimizer, Apache Doris can easily access external data sources, for instance, Hive, Iceberg and Hudi. And the speed of access is 3-5 times faster than  Trino/Presto and 10-100 times faster than Hive.\\n\\n![lakehouse](/images/summit/en/lakehouse.png)\\n\\n# 2023 RoadMap\\n\\nIn 2023, the Apache Doris community will deep dive into new features development, as you can refer to the 2023 RoadMap and the specific plan for next year below:\\n\\n![roadmap](/images/summit/en/roadmap.png)\\n\\nIn 2023, we will start the iteration of Apache Doris 2.x version on a quarterly basis . At the same time, for each 2-bit version, bug fixes and upgrades will be done on a monthly basis.\\nFrom a functional point of view, the follow-up research and development will focus on the following main directions:\\n\\n## High Performance\\n\\nHigh performance is the goal that Apache Doris is constantly pursuing. Doris\' excellent performance on public test datasets such as Clickbench and TPC-H has proved that it has become industry-leading. In the future, we will further enhance performance, including:\\n- More complex SQL: The new query optimizer will be available in the first quarter of 2023. The new query optimizer supports the strategy of combining RBO and CBO, and it can support complex queries more efficiently and fully execute all 99 SQLs of TPC-DS. \\n- Higher concurrency point query: High concurrency is always what Apache Doris is good at. And in 2023 we will further strengthen this capability through a series of features such as Short-Circuit Plan, Prepare Statement, Query Cache, etc., to support ultra-high concurrency of 10,000 QPS with single node and has higher-concurrency scaling out.\\n- More flexible multi-table materialized views: In previous versions, Apache Doris accelerated the analysis efficiency of fixed-dimensional data through strengthen single-table materialized views. The new multi-table materialized view will decouple the lifecycle of Base table and the MV table. In this way, Doris can easily deal with the multi-table JOINs and the pre-calculation acceleration of more complex SQL queries. And Doris is capable of asynchronous refresh and flexible incremental calculation methods. This feature will be available in the first quarter of 2023.\\n\\n## Cost-effective\\n\\nCost efficiency is the key to winning market competition for enterprises, which is true for databases as well. In the past, Apache Doris helped users greatly save the cost in computing and storage resources with many designs of ease of use. In the future, we will introduce a series of cloud-native capabilities to further reduce costs without affecting business efficiency, including:\\n- Lower storage costs: We will explore the combination of object storage systems and file systems on the cloud to help users further reduce storage costs, including better separation of hot and cold data, and migrate cold data to cheaper object storage or file system. Combining technologies such as a single remote replica, cold data cache, and hot & cold data conversion, we can ensure that query efficiency is not affected while saving up storage costs. This feature will be released in the first quarter of 2023.\\n- More elastic computing resources: We plan to separate storage and computing state and adopt Elastic Compute Node for computing. Since no data is stored, Elastic Computing Nodes have faster elastic scaling capabilities, which is convenient for users to quickly scale out during peak business periods, and further improve the analysis efficiency in massive data computing, such as lakehouse analysis. This function will be released shortly. \\n\\n## Hybrid Workload\\n\\nLots of users nowadays are building a unified analysis platform within the enterprise based on Apache Doris. On the one hand, Apache Doris is required to execute larger-scale data processing and analysis. On the other hand, Apache Doris is also required to deal with more analytical load challenges, such as real-time reports and Ad-hoc to ELT/ETL, log retrieval and more unified analysis. In order to better adapt to these cases, new features are about to be released in 2023, which include:\\n- Pipeline execution engine: Compared with the traditional volcano model, the Pipeline model does not need to set the concurrency manually, but instead, it can do parallel computing between different pipelines, making full usage of CPUs and is more flexible in execution scheduling, which improves the overall performance under mixed load cases.\\n- Workload Manager: It is also urgent to improve resource isolation and division capabilities. Based on the Pipeline execution engine, we will launch features such as flexible load management, resource queues, and isolation in shared services to balance query performance and stability in various mixed load cases.\\n- Lightweight fault tolerance: It can not only take advantage of the high efficiency of MPP structure but also tolerate errors to better adapt to the challenges of users in ETL/ELT.\\n- Function compatibility and UDF in multiple languages: At the same time, we will be more compatible with Hive/Trino/Spark function and support multiple UDF in the future to help users process data more flexibly. And data migration to Apache Doris will be easier than before.\\n\\n## Multi-model Data Analysis\\n\\nIn the past, Apache Doris was quite good at structured data analysis. As the demand for semi-structured and unstructured data analysis increased, we added Array and JSONB types from version 1.2 to support these data types naturally. In the future release, we will continue providing more cost-effective and better-performance solutions for log analysis cases, including:\\n- Richer complex data types: In addition to Array/JSONB types, we will increase support for Map/Struct types in the first quarter of 2023, including efficient writing, storage, analysis functions to better perform multi-model data analysis. In the future, more data types will be supported, such as IP and GEO geographic information, and more time series data.\\n- More efficient text analysis algorithms: For text data, we will introduce text analysis algorithms, including adaptive Like, high-performance substring matching, high-performance regular matching, predicate pushdown of Like statements, Ngram Bloomfilter, etc. The full-text search is based on the inverted index and it provides higher performance and is more cost-effective in analysis compared with that of  Elasticsearch in the log analysis. These features will come out in early 2023.\\n-Dynamic Schema table: In other databases, the schema is relatively static and DDL needs to be executed manually when the schema is changed. In recent cases, the table structure changes all the time, so we plan to launch Dynamic Table, which can automatically adapt to the Schema according to data writing without DDL execution, replacing manual adjusting. This feature will be released in the first quarter of 2023.\\n\\n## Lakehouse\\n\\nWith the development of data lake technology, analysis performance has become the biggest constraint to data-mining. Building analysis services on top of data lakes based on an easy-to-use and high-performance query analysis engine has become a new trend. In the last year, through many performance optimizations on the data lake, high-performance execution engine and query optimizer, Apache Doris has become extremely fast in analysis and easy-to-use on the data lake with a performance 3-5 times higher than that of Presto/Trino. In 2023, we will continue to go deeper, including:\\n- Easier data access: In version 1.2, we released Multi-Catalog, which supports automatic metadata mapping and synchronization of multiple heterogeneous data sources and is used for accessing data lakes. Delta Lake, Iceberg and Hudi will be better supported.\\n- More complete data lake capabilities: We provide incremental update and query of data on the data lake. Analysis result will be sent to data lake and the data from external tables will be ingested into internal tables. At the same time, Doris will also support multi-version Snapshot\'s read & delete and materialized views.\\n\\n## Real-time and storage engine optimization\\n\\nThe value of data will decrease over time, so real-time performance is very important for users. The Merge-on-Write data update in version 1.2 allows Apache Doris to be fast in both real-time updating and query. In 2023, we will upgrade the storage engine with the following:\\n- More stable data writing: Through a series of compaction operations and optimization of batch processing, resource cost is able to be saved. And through a new memory management framework, stability of the writing process will be improved.\\n- More mature data-updating mechanism: In the past, column updates were implemented through Replace_if_not_null on the Agg model. In the future, we will increase support for partial column updates with the Unique Key model, and data updates such as Delete, Update, and Merge.\\n- A unified data model: Currently, the three data models of Apache Doris are widely used in various cases. In the future, we will try to unify the existing data models to provide a better user experience.\\n\\n## Ease of use and stability\\n\\nIn addition to improving functions, simplicity, ease of use and stability is also the goal that Apache Doris has been pursuing. In 2023, we will dive deeper in the following:\\n- Simplified table creation: Currently, Apache Doris already supports time functions in table partitioning. In the future, we will further simplify Bucket settings to help users build models easily.\\n- Security: At present, a permission management mechanism based on the RBAC model has been launched, which makes user permissions more secure and reliable. Functions such as ID-federation, Row&Column-level permissions, data desensitization will be further improved in the future.\\n- Observability: Profile is an important means of locating query performance problems. In the future, we will strengthen the monitoring of Profile and provide visualized Profile tools to help users locate problems faster.\\n- Better BI compatibility and data migration solution: Currently, various BI tools can be connected with Apache Doris through MySQL protocol, and we will further adapt mainstream BI software in the future to ensure a better query experience. With the rise of emerging data integration and migration tools such as DBT and Airbyte, more and more users synchronize data to Apache Doris in this way. So we should provide support for these users in the future.\\n\\n# How to join the community\\n\\nLast but not the least, we hope that more developers can participate in the community to jointly create a powerful database. There are 3 ways to participate in the community. First of all, users can subscribe to our developer mailing group through this address: dev@doris.apache.org, which is recommended by the Apache Way as well. You can send any related topics that you want to discuss with the community. Secondly, you can reach out to us virtually on developer\'s biweekly meeting. The biweekly meeting is held on Wednesdays at 8pm(UTC+8). The topic will cover new features, disclosure and development progress and more. Thirdly, the DSIP.

This article describes the evolution of data warehouse in LY Digital and why we switch to Apache Doris. I hope you like it.\\n\\n> Author: XingWang, Lead Developer of LY Digital\\n\\n![kv](/images/LY/en/kv.png)\\n\\n# 1. Background\\n\\n## 1.1 About LY Digital\\n\\nLY Digital is a tourism financial service platform under LY. Com. Formally established in 2015, LY Digital takes \\"Digital technology empowers the tourism industry.\\" as its vision.\\nAt present, LY Digital\'s business covers financial services, consumer financial services, financial technology and digital technology. So far, more than 10 million users and 76 cities have enjoyed our services.\\n\\n## 1.2 Requirements for Data Warehouse\\n\\n- Dashboard: Needs dashboard for T+1 business, etc.\\n- Early Warning System: Needs risk control, anomaly capital management and traffic monitoring, etc.\\n- Business Analysis: Needs timely data query analysis and temporary data retrieval, etc.\\n- Finance: Needs liquidation and payment reconciliation.\\n\\n# 2. Previous Data Warehouse\\n\\n## 2.1 Architecture\\n\\n![page_1](/images/LY/en/page_1.png)\\n\\nOur previous data warehouse adopted the combination of SteamSets and Apache Kudu, which was very popular in the past few years. In this architecture, Binlog is ingested into Apache Kudu after passing through StreamSets in real-time, and is finally queried and used through Apache Impala and visualization tools.\\n\\n### 2.1.2 Downside\\n\\n- The previous data warehouse has a sophisticated structure that consists of many components that interact with one another, which requires huge operation and maintenance costs. \\n- The previous data warehouse has a sophisticated structure that consists of many components that interact with one another, which requires huge operation and maintenance costs.\\n- Apache Kudu\'s performance in wide tables Join is not so good.\\n- SLA is not fully guaranteed because tenant isolation is not provided.\\n- Although SteamSets are equipped with early warning capabilities, job recovery capabilities are still poor. When configuring multiple tasks, the JVM consumes a lot, resulting in slow recovery.\\n\\n# 3. New Data Warehouse\\n\\n## 3.1 Research of Popular Data Warehouses\\n\\nDue to so many shortcomings, we had to give up the previous data warehouse. In 2020, we conducted an in-depth research on the popular data warehouses in the market.\\n\\nDuring the research, we focused on comparing Clickhouse and Apache Doris. ClickHouse has a high utilization rate of CPU, so it performs well in single-table query. But it does not perform well in multitable Joins and high QPS. On the other hand, Doris can not only support thousands of QPS per node. Thanks to the function of partitioning, it can also support high-concurrency queries at the QPS level of 10,000. Moreover, the horiziontal scaling in and out of ClickHouse are complex, which cannot be done automatically at present. Doris supports online dynamic scaling, and can be expanded horizontally according to the development of the business.\\n\\nIn the research, Apache Doris stood out. Doris\'s high-concurrency query capability is very attractive. Its dynamic scaling capabilities are also suitable for our flexible advertising business. So we chose Apache Doris for sure.\\n\\n![page_2](/images/LY/en/page_2.png)\\n\\nAfter introducing Apache Doris, we upgraded the entire data warehouse:\\n- We collect MySQL Binlog through Canal and then it is ingested into Kafka. Because Apache Doris is highly capatible with Kafka, we can easily use Routine Load to load and import data.\\n- We have made minor adjustments to the batch processing. For data stored in Hive, Apache Doris can ingest data from Hive through Broker Load. In this way, the data in batch processing can be directly ingested into Doris.\\n\\n## 3.2 Why We Choose Doris\\n\\n![page_3](/images/LY/en/page_3.png)\\n\\nThe overall performance of Apache Doris is impressive:\\n- Data access: It provides rich data import methods and can support the access of many types of data sources;\\n- Data connection: Doris supports JDBC and ODBC connections. And it can easily connect with BI tools. In addition, Doris uses the MySQL protocol for communication. Users can directly access Doris through various Client tools;\\n- SQL syntax: Doris adopts MySQL protocol and it is highly compatible with MySQL syntax, supporting standard SQL, and is low in learning costs for developers;\\n- MPP parallel computing: Doris provides excellent parallel computing capabilities and has obvious advantages in complex Join and wide table Join;\\n- Fully-completed documentation: Doris official documentation is very profound, which is friendly for new users. \\n\\n\\n## 3.3  Architecture of Real-time Processing \\n\\n![page_4](/images/LY/en/page_4.png)\\n\\n- Data source: In real-time processing, data sources come from business branches such as industrial finance, consumer finance, and risk control. They are all collected through Canal and API.\\n- Data collection: After data collection through Canal-Admin, Canal sends the data to Kafka message queue. After that, the data is ingested into the Doris through Routine Load.\\n- Inside Doris: The Doris cluster constitutes a  three-level layer of the data warehouse, namely: the DWD layer with the Unique model, the DWS layer with the Aggregation model, and the ADS application layer.\\n- Data application: The data is applied in three aspects: real-time dashboard, data timeliness analysis and data service.\\n\\n## 3.4 New Features\\n\\nThe data import method is simple and adopts 3 different import methods according to different scenarios:\\n- Routine Load: When we submit the Rountine Load task, there will be a process within Doris that consumes Kafka in real time, continuously reads data from Kafka and ingestes it into Doris.\\n- Broker Load: Offline data such as dim-tables and historical data are ingested into Doris in an orderly manner.\\n- Insert Into: Used for batch processing tasks, Insert into is responsible for processing data in the DWD layer\\n\\nDoris\' data model improves our development efficiency:\\n- The Unique model is used when accessing the DWD layer, which can effectively prevent repeated consumption of data.\\n-  In Doris, aggregation supports 4 models, such as Sum, Replace, Min, and Max. In this way, it may reduce a large amount of SQL code,  and no longer allow us to manually write Sum, Min, Max and other codes.\\n\\nDoris query is efficient:\\n- It supports materialized view and Rollup materialized index. The bottom layer of the materialized view is similar to the concept of Cube and the precomputation process. As a way of exchanging space for time, special tables are generated at the bottom layer. In the query, materialized view maps to the tables and responds quickly.\\n\\n# 4. Benefits of the New Data Warehouse\\n\\n- Data access: In the previous architecture, the Kudu table needs to be created manually during the imports through SteamSets. Lack of tools, the entire process of creating tables and tasks takes 20-30 minutes. Nowadays, fast data access can be realized through the platform. The access process of each table has been shortened from the previous 20-30 minutes to the current 3-5 minutes, which is to say that the performance has been improved by 5-6 times.\\n- Data development: After using Doris, we can directly use the data models, such as Unique and Aggregation.  The Duplicate model can well support logs, greatly speeding up the development process in ETL.\\n- Query analysis: The bottom layer of Doris has functions such as materialized view and Rollup materialized index. Moreover, Doris has made many optimizations for wide table associations, such as Runtime Filter and other Joins. Compared with Doris, Apache Kudu requires more complex optimization to be better used.\\n- Data report: It took 1-2 minutes to complete the rendering when we used Kudu to query before, but Doris responded in seconds or even milliseconds.\\n- Easy maintenance: Doris is not as complex as Hadoop. In March, our IDC was relocated, and 12 Doris virtual machines were all migrated within three days. The overall operation is relatively simple. In addition to physically moving the machine, FE\'s scaling only requires simple commands such as Add and Drop, which do not take a long time to do.\\n\\n# 5. Look ahead\\n\\n- Realize data access based on Flink CDC: At present, Flink CDC is not introduced, but Kafka through Canal instead. The development efficiency can be even faster if we use Flink CDC. Flink CDC still needs us to write a certain amount of code, which is not friendly for data analysts to use directly. We hope that data analysts only need to write simple SQL or directly operate. In the future planning, we plan to introduce Flink CDC.\\n- Keep up with the latest release: Now the latest version Apache Doris V1.2.0 has made great achievements in vectorization, multi-catalog, and light schema change. We will keep up with the community to upgrade the cluster and make full use of new features.\\n- Strengthen the construction of related systems: Our current index system management, such as report metadata, business metadata, and other management levels still need to be improved. Although we have data quality monitoring functions, it still needs to be strengthened and improved in automation."},{"id":"/release-1.1.5","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-1.1.5","source":"@site/blog/release-1.1.5.md","title":"Apache Doris announced the official release of version 1.1.5","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2022-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 19, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Release Notes","permalink":"/blog/tags/release-notes"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Apache Doris"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Apache Doris announced the official release of version 1.1.5","summary":"Dear community, we are pleased to announce that we have officially released Apache Doris 1.1.5 on December 19, 2022","date":"2022-12-19","author":"Apache Doris","tags":["Release Notes"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Best Practice: The Efficiency of the Data Warehouse Greatly Improved in LY Digital","permalink":"/blog/LY"},"nextItem":{"title":"Best Practice in Kwai: Apache Doris on Elasticsearch","permalink":"/blog/BestPractice_Kwai"}},"content":"\x3c!--\\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\\nor more contributor license agreements.

And it also provides query service for multi-dimensional analysis reports for internal users. The engine is committed to dealing with high-performance, high-concurrency, and high-stability query problems in multi-dimensional analysis report cases.\\n\\n# 2 Previous Architecture\\n\\n## 2.1 Background\\nTraditional OLAP engines deal with multi-dimensional analysis in a more pre-modeled way, by building a data cube (Cube) to perform operations such as Drill-down, Roll-up, Slice, and Dice and Pivot. Modern OLAP analysis introduces the idea of \u200b\u200ba relational model, representing data in two-dimensional relational tables. In the modeling process, usally there are two modeling methods. One is to ingest the data of multiple tables into one wide table through Join; the other is to use the star schema, divide the data into fact table and dim-table.  And then Join them when querying. \\nBoth options have some pros and cons:\\n\\nWide table:\\n\\nTaking the idea of \u200b\u200bexchanging space for time. The primary key of the dim-table is the unique ID to fill all dimensions, and multiple dimension data is stored in redundant storage. Its advantage is that it is convenient to query, unnecessary to associate additional dim-tables, which is way better. The disadvantage is that if there is a change in dimension data, the entire table needs to be refreshed, which is bad for high-frequency Update.\\n\\nStar Schema:\\n\\nDimension data is completely separated from fact data. Dimension data is often stored in a dedicated engine (such as MySQL, Elasticsearch, etc.). When querying, dimension data is associated with the primary key. The advantage is that changes in dimension data do not affect fact data, which can support high-frequency Update operations. The disadvantage is that the query logic is relatively more complex, and multi-table Join may lead to performance loss.\\n\\n## 2.2 Requirement for an OLAP Engine\\n\\nIn Kwai\u2019s business, the commercial reports engine supports the real-time query of the advertising effect for advertisers. When building the report engine, we expect to meet the following requirements:\\n- Immersive data: the original data of a single table increases by ten billion every day\\n- High QPS in Query: thousand-level QPS on average\\n- High stability requirements: SLA level of 99.9999 %\\n\\nMost importantly, due to frequent changes in dimension data, dim-tables need to support Update operations up to thousand-level QPS and further support requirements such as fuzzy matching and word segmentation retrieval.\\nBased on the above requirements, we chose star schema and built a report engine architecture with Apache Druid and Elasticsearch.\\n\\n## 2.3 Previous Architecture: Based on Apache Druid\\n\\nWe chose the combination of Elasticsearch and Apache Druid. In data import, we use Flink to pre-aggregate the data at minute-evel, and use Kafka to pre-aggregate the data at hour-level. In data query, the application initiates a query request through RE Front API, and Re Query initiates queries to the dim-table engine (Elasticsearch and MySQL) and the extension engine respectively.\\n\\nDruid is a timing-based query engine that supports real-time data ingestion and is used to store and query large amounts of fact data. We adopt Elasticseach based on those concerns:\\n- High update frequency, QPS is around 1000\\n- Support word segmentation and fuzzy search, which is suitable for Kwai\\n- Supports high-level dim-table data, which can be directly qualified without adopting sub-database and sub-table just like MySQL database\\n- Supports data synchronization monitoring, and has check and recovery services as well\\n\\n## 2.4 Engine of the Reports\\n\\nThe report engine can be divided into two layers: REFront and REQuery. REMeta is an independent metadata management module. The report engine implements MEMJoin inside REQuery. It supports associative query between fact data in Druid and dimension data in Elasticsearch. And it also provides virtual cube query for upper-layer business, avoiding the exposion of complex cross-engine management and query logic.\\n\\n![page_1](/images/Kwai/en/page_1.png)\\n\\n# 3 New Architecture Based on Apache Doris\\n\\n## 3.1 Problems Remained \\nFirst, we came across a problem when we build the report engine. Mem Join is single-machine with serial execution. When the amount of data pulled from Elasticsearch exceeds 100,000 at a single time, the response time is close to 10s, and the user experience is poor. Moreover, using a single node to execute large-scale data Join will consume a lot of memory, causing Full GC.\\n\\nSecond, Druid\'s Lookup Join function is not so perfect, which is a big problem, and it cannot fully meet our business needs.\\n\\n## 3.2 Database Research\\n\\nSo we conducted a survey on popular OLAP databases in the industry, the most representative of which are Apache Doris and Clickhouse. We found out that Apache Doris is more capable of Join between large and wide tables. ClickHouse can support Broadcast memory-based Join, but the performance  is not good for the Join between large and wide tables with a large data volume. Both Doris and Clickhouse support detailed data storage, but the capability for concurrency of Clickhouse is low. On the contrary, Doris supports high-concurrency and low-latency query services, and a single machine supports up to thousands of QPS. When the concurrency increases, horizontal expansion of FE and BE can be supported. However, Clickhouse\'s data import is not able to support Transaction SQL, which cannot realize Exactly-once semantics and has limited ablility for standard SQL. In contrast, Doris provides Transaction SQL and atomicity for data import. Doris itself can ensure that messages in Kafka are not lost or re-subscribed, which is to say, Exactly-Once semantics is supported. ClickHouse has high learning cost, high operation and maintenance costs, and weak in distribution. The fact that it requires more customization and deeper technical strength is another problem. Doris is different. There are only two core components, FE and BE, and there are fewer external dependencies. We also found that because Doris is closer to the MySQL protocol, it is more convenient than Clickhouse and the cost of migration is not so large. In terms of horizontal expansion, Doris\' expansion and contraction can also achieve self-balancing, which is much better than that of Clickhouse.\\n\\nFrom this point of view, Doris can better improve the performance of Join and is much better in other aspects such as migration cost, horizontal expansion, and concurrency. However, Elasticsearch has inherent advantages in high-frequency Update.\\n\\nIt would be an ideal solution to deal with high-frequency Upate and Join performance at the same time by building engines through Doris on Elasticsearch.\\n\\n## 3.3 Good Choice: Doris on Elasticsearch\\n\\nWhat is the query performance of Doris on Elasticsearch?\\n\\nFirst of all, Apache Doris is a real-time analytical database based on MPP architecture, with strong performance and strong horizontal expansion capability. Doris on Elasticsearch takes advantage on this capability and does a lot of query optimization. Secondly, after integrating Elasticsearch, we have also made a lot of optimizations to the query:\\n- Shard-level concurrency\\n- Automatic adaptation of row and column scanning, priority to column scanning\\n- Sequential read, terminated early\\n- Two-phase query becomes one-phase query\\n- Broadcast Join is especially friendly for small batch data\\n\\n![page_2](/images/Kwai/en/page_2.png)\\n\\n## 3.4 Doris on Elasticsearch\\n\\n### 3.4.1 Data Link Upgrade\\n\\nThe upgrade of the data link is relatively simple. In the first step, in Doris we build a new Olap table and configure the materialized view. Second, the routine load is initiated based on the Kafka topic of the previous fact data, and then real-time data is ingested. The third step is to ingest offline data from Hive\'s broker load. The last step is to create an Elasticsearch external table through Doris.\\n\\n![page_3](/images/Kwai/en/page_3.png)\\n\\n### 3.4.2 Upgrades of the Report Engine\\n\\n![page_4](/images/Kwai/en/page_4.png)\\n\\nNote: The MySQL dim-table associated above is based on future planning. Currently, Elasticsearch is mainly used as the dim-table engine\\n\\nReport Engine Adaptation\\n- Generate virtual cube table based on Doris\'s star schema\\n- Adapt to cube table query analysis, intelligent Push-down\\n- Gray Release\\n\\n# 4  Online Performance\\n\\n## 4.1 Fact Table Query Performance Comparison\\n\\nDruid\\n\\n![page_5](/images/Kwai/en/page_5.png)\\n\\nDoris\\n\\n![page_6](/images/Kwai/en/page_6.png)\\n\\n99th percentile of response time: \\nDruid: 270ms, Doris: 150ms and which is reduced by 45%\\n\\n## 4.2 Comparison of Cube Table Query Performance in Join\\n\\nDruid\\n\\n![page_7](/images/Kwai/en/page_7.png)\\n\\nDoris\\n\\n![page_8](/images/Kwai/en/page_8.png)\\n\\n99th percentile of response time: \\nDruid: 660ms, Doris: 440ms and which is reduced by 33%\\n\\n## 4.3 Benefits\\n\\n- The overall time consumption of 99 percentile is reduced by about 35%\\n- Resource saving about 50%\\n- Remove the complex logic of MemJoin from the report engine; Realize through DO(in the case of large query: dim-table results exceed 100,000, performance improvement exceeds 10 times, 10s to 1s)\\n- Richer query semantics (Mem Join is relatively simple and does not support complex queries)\\n\\n# 5  Summary and Plans\\n\\nIn Kwai\'s commercial business, Join queries between dimension data and fact data is very common. After using Doris, query becomes simple. We only need to synchronize the fact table and dim-table on a daily basis and Join while querying. By replacing Druid and Clickhouse with Doris, Doris basically covers all scenarios when we use Druid. In this way, Kwai\'s commercial report engine greatly improves the aggregation and analysis capabilities of massive data. During the use of Apache Doris, we also found some unexpected benefits: For example, the import method of Routine Load and Broker Load is relatively simple, which improves the query speed; The data occupation is greatly reduced; Doris supports the MySQL protocol, which is much easier for data analyst to fetch data and make charts.\\n\\nAlthough the Doris on Elasticsearch has fully meet our requirement, Elasticsearch external table still requires manual creation. However, Apache Doris recently released the latest version V1.2.0. The new version has added Multi-Catlog, which provides the ability to seamlessly access external table sources such as Hive, Elasticsearch, Hudi, and Iceberg. Users can connect to external tables through the CREATE CATALOG command, and Doris will automatically map the library and table information of the external dable. In this way, we don\'t need to manually create the Elasticsearch external tables to complete the mapping in the future, which greatly saves us time and cost of development and improves the efficiency of research and development. The power of other new functions such as Vectorization and Ligt Schema Change also gives us new expectations for Apache Doris.

At present, Apache Doris has been widely used in dozens of business departments within Xiaomi. A set of data ecology with Apache Doris has been formed. This article is transcribed from an online meetup speech of the Doris community, aiming to share the practice of Apache Doris in Xiaomi.\\n\\n> Author: ZuoWei, OLAP Engineer, Xiaomi\\n\\n![kv](/images/xiaomi/en/kv.png)\\n\\n# About Xiaomi\\n[Xiaomi Corporation](https://www.mi.com/global) (\u201cXiaomi\u201d or the \u201cGroup\u201d; HKG:1810), a consumer electronics and smart manufacturing company with smartphones and smart hardware connected by an Internet of Things (IoT) platform.  In 2021, Xiaomi\'s total revenue amounted to RMB328.3 billion(USD472,231,316,200), an increase of 33.5% year-over-year; Adjusted net profit was RMB22.0 billion(USD3,164,510,800), an increase of 69.5% year-over-year.\\n\\nDue to the growing need of data analysis, Xiaomi Group introduced Apache Doris in 2019. As one of the earliest users of Apache Doris, Xiaomi Group has been deeply involved in the open-source community. After three years of development, Apache Doris has been widely used in dozens of business departments within Xiaomi, such as Advertising, New Retail, Growth Analysis, Dashboards, UserPortraits, [AISTAR](https://airstar.com/home), [Xiaomi Youpin](https://www.xiaomiyoupin.com). Within Xiaomi, a data ecosystem has been built around Apache Doris. \\n\\n![page_1](/images/xiaomi/en/page_1.jpg)\\n\\nAt present, Apache Doris already has dozens of clusters in Xiaomi, with an overall scale of hundreds of virtual machines . Among them, the largest single cluster reaches nearly 100 nodes, with dozens of real-time data synchronization tasks. And the largest daily increment of a single table rocket to 12 billion, supporting PB-level storage. And a single cluster can support more than 20,000 multi-dimensional analysis queries per day.\\n\\n# Architecture Evolution\\nThe original intention of Xiaomi to introduce Apache Doris is to solve the problems encountered in user behavior analysis. With the development of Xiaomi\'s Internet business, the demand for growth analysis using user behavior data is becoming stronger and stronger. If each business branch builds its own growth analysis system, it will not only be costly, but also inefficient. Therefore, if there is a product that can help them stop worrying about underlying complex technical details, it would be great to have relevant business personnel focus on their own technical work. In this way, it can greatly improve work efficiency. Therefore, Xiaomi Big Data and the cloud platform jointly developed the growth analysis system called Growing Analytics (referred to as GA), which aims to provide a flexible multi-dimensional real-time query and analysis platform, which can manage data access and query solutions in a unified way, and help business branches to refine operation.\\n\\n## Previous Architecture\\nThe growth analysis platform project was established in mid-2018. At that time, based on the consideration of development time and cost, Xiaomi reused various existing big data basic components (HDFS, Kudu, SparkSQL, etc.) to build a growth analysis query system based on Lambda architecture. The architecture of the first version of the GA system is shown in the figure below, including the following aspects:\\n\\n- Data Source: The data source is the front-end embedded data and user behavior data.\\n- Data Access: The event tracking data is uniformly cleaned and ingested into Xiaomi\'s internal self-developed message queue, and the data is imported into Kudu through Spark Streaming.\\n- Storage: Separate hot and cold data in the storage layer. Hot data is stored in Kudu, and cold data is stored in HDFS. At the same time, partitioning is carried out in the storage layer. When the partition unit is day, part of the data will be cooled and stored on HDFS every night.\\n- Compute and Query: In the query layer, use SparkSQL to perform federated queries on the data on Kudu and HDFS, and finally display the query results on the front-end page.\\n\\n![page_2](/images/xiaomi/en/page_2.jpg)\\n\\nAt that time, the first version of the growth analysis platform helped us solve a series of problems in the user operation process, but there were also two problems:\\n\\n### Problem No.1: Scattered components\\nSince the historical architecture is based on the combination of SparkSQL + Kudu + HDFS, too many dependent components lead to high operation and maintenance costs. The original design is that each component uses the resources of the public cluster, but in practice, it is found that during the execution of the query job, the query performance is easily affected by other jobs in the public cluster, and query jitter is prone to occur, especially when reading data from the HDFS public cluster , sometimes slower.\\n\\n### Problem No.2: High resource consumption\\nWhen querying through SparkSQL, the latency is relatively high. SparkSQL is a query engine designed based on a batch processing system. In the process of exchanging data shuffle between each stage, it still needs to be placed on the disk, and the delay in completing the SQL query is relatively high. In order to ensure that SQL queries are not affected by resources, we ensure query performance by adding machines. However, in practice, we find that there is limited room for performance improvement. This solution cannot make full use of machine resources to achieve efficient queries. A certain waste of resources.\\n\\nIn response to the above two problems, our goal is to seek an MPP database that integrates computing and storage to replace our current storage and computing layer components. After technical selection, we finally decided to use Apache Doris to replace the older generation of historical architecture.\\n\\n## New Choice\\nPopular MPP-based query engines such as Impala and Presto, can efficiently support SQL queries, but they still need to rely on Kudu, HDFS, Hive Metastore and other storage system, which increase the operation and maintenance costs. At the same time, due to the separation of storage and compute, the query engine cannot easily find the data changes in the storage layer, resulting in bad performance in detailed query optimization. If you want to cache at the SQL layer, you cannot guarantee that the query results are up-to-date.\\n\\nApache Doris is a top-level project of the Apache Foundation. It is mainly positioned as a high-performance, real-time analytical database, and is mainly used to solve reports and multi-dimensional analysis. It integrates Google Mesa and Cloudera Impala technologies. We conducted an in-depth performance tests on Doris and communicated with the community many times. And finally, we determined to replace the previous computing and storage components with Doris. \\n\\n## New Architecture Based on Apache Doris\\nThe new architecture obtains event tracking data from the data source. Then data is ingested  into Apache Doris. Query results can be directly displayed in the applications. In this way, Doris has truly realized the unification of computing, storage, and resource management tools.\\n\\n![page_3](/images/xiaomi/en/page_3.jpg)\\n\\nWe chose Doris because:\\n- Doris has excellent query performance and can meet our business needs.\\n- Doris supports standard SQL, and the learning cost is low.\\n- Doris does not depend on other external components and is easy to operate and maintain.\\n- The Apache Doris community is very active and friendly, crowded with contributors. It is easier for further versions upgrades and convenient for maintenance.\\n\\n## Query Performance Comparision between Apache Doris & Spark SQL\\nNote: The comparison is based on Apache Doris V0.13\\n\\n![page_4](/images/xiaomi/en/page_4.jpg)\\n\\nWe selected a business model with an average daily data volume of about 1 billion, and conducted performance tests on Doris in different scenarios, including 6 event analysis scenarios, 3 retention analysis scenarios, and 3 funnel analysis scenarios. After comparing it with the previous architecture(SparkSQL+Kudu+HDFS), we found out:\\n- In the event analysis scenario, the average query time was reduced by 85%.\\n- In the scenarios of retention analysis and funnel analysis, the average query time was reduced by 50%.\\n\\n# Real Practice\\nBelow we will introduce our experience of data import, data query, A/B test in the business application of Apache Doris.\\n\\n## Data Import\\n\\n![page_5](/images/xiaomi/en/page_5.jpg)\\n\\nXiaomi writes data into Doris mainly through Stream Load, Broker Load and a small amount of data by Insert. Usually data is generally ingested into the message queue first, which is divided into real-time and offline data.\\n\\n### How to write real-time data into Apache Doris: \\nAfter part of real-time data processed by Flink, they will be ingested into Doris through  Flink-Doris-Connector provided by Apache Doris. The rest of the data is ingested through Spark Streaming. The bottom layer of these two writing approaches both rely on the Stream Load provided by Apache Doris.\\n\\n### How to write offline data into Apache Doris: \\nAfter offline data is partially ingested into Hive, they will be ingested into Doris through Xiaomi\'s data import tool. Users can directly submit Broker Load tasks to the Xiaomi\'s data import tool and import data directly into Doris, or import data through Spark SQL, which relies on the Spark-Doris-Connector provided by Apache Doris. Spark Doris Connector is actually the encapsulation of Stream Load.\\n\\n## Data Qurey\\n\\n![page_6](/images/xiaomi/en/page_6.jpg)\\n\\nUsers can query after data import is done. Inside Xiaomi, we query through our data platform. Users can perform visual queries on Doris through Xiaomi\'s data platform, and conduct user behavior analysis and user portrait analysis. In order to help our teams conduct event analysis, retention analysis, funnel analysis, path analysis and other behavioral analysis, we have added corresponding UDF (User Defined Function) and UDAF (User Defined Aggregate Function) to Doris.\\n\\nIn the upcoming version 1.2, Apache Doris adds the function of synchronizing metadata through external table, such as Hive/Hudi/Iceberg and Multi Catalog tool. External table query improves performance, and the ability to access external tables greatly increases ease of use. In the future, we will consider querying Hive and Iceberg data directly through Doris, which builds an architecture of datalake.\\n\\n## A/B Test\\nIn real business, the A/B test is a method of comparing two versions of strategies against each other to determine which one performs better. A/B test is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis. It is popular approach used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal. Xiaomi\'s A/B test platform is an operation tool product that conducts the A/B test with experimental grouping, traffic splitting, and scientific evaluation to assist in decision making. Xiaomi\'s A/B test platform has several query applications: user deduplication, indicator summation, covariance calculation, etc. The query types will involve Count (distinct), Bitmap, Like, etc.\\n\\nApache Doris also provides services to Xiaomi\'s A/B test platform. Everyday, Xiaomi\'s A/B test platform needs to process a temendous amount of data with billions of queries. That\'s why Xiaomi\'s A/B test platform is eager to improve the query performance. \\n\\nApache Doris V1.1 released just in time and has fully supported vectorization in the processing and storage. Compared with the non-vectorized version, the query performance has been significantly improved. It is time to update Xiaomi\'s Doris cluster to the latest version. That\'s why we first launched the latest vectorized version of Doris on Xiaomi\'s A/B test platform.\\n\\n## Test before Launch\\nNote: The following tests are based on Apache Doris V1.1.2\\n\\nWe built a test cluster for Apache Doris V1.1.2, which is as big as that of the Xiaomi online Apache Doris V0.13 version, to test before the vectorization version goes online. The test is divided into two aspects: single SQL parrellel query test and batch SQL concurrent query test.\\n\\nThe configurations of the two clusters are exactly the same, and the specific configuration information is as follows:\\n- Scale: 3 FEs + 89 virtual machines\\n- CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4216 CPU @ 2.10GHz 16 cores 32 threads \xd7 2\\n- Memory: 256GB\\n- Disk: 7.3TB \xd7 12 HDD\\n\\n### Single SQL Parrellel Query Test\\nWe choose 7 classic queries in the Xiaomi A/B test. For each query, we limited the time range to 1 day, 7 days, and 20 days for testing, where the daily partition data size is about 3.1 billion (the data volume is about 2 TB). The test results are shown in the figures:\\n\\n![page_7](/images/xiaomi/en/page_7.jpg)\\n\\n![page_8](/images/xiaomi/en/page_8.jpg)\\n\\n![page_9](/images/xiaomi/en/page_9.jpg)\\n\\nThe Apache Doris V1.1.2 has at least 3~5 times performance improvement compared to the Xiaomi online Doris V0.13, which is remarkable.\\n\\n## Optimization\\nNote: The following tests are based on Apache Doris V1.1.2\\n\\nBased on Xiaomi\'s A/B test business data, we tuned Apache Doris V1.1.2 and conducted concurrent query tests on the tuned Doris V1.1.2 and Xiaomi\'s online Doris V0.13. The test results are as follows.\\n\\n### Optimization in Test 1\\nWe choose user deduplication, index summation, and covariance calculation query(the total number of SQL is 3245) in the A/B test to conduct concurrent query tests on the two versions. The single-day partition data of the table is about 3.1 billion (the amount of data is about 2 TB) and the query will be based on the latest week\'s data. The test results are shown in the figures:\\n\\n![page_10](/images/xiaomi/en/page_10.jpg)\\n\\nCompared with Apache Doris V0.13, the overall average latency of Doris V1.1.2 is reduced by about 48%, and the P95 latency is reduced by about 49%. In this test, the query performance of Doris V1.1.2 was nearly doubled compared to Doris V0.13.\\n\\n### Optimization in Test 2\\nWe choose 7 A/B test reports to test the two versions. Each A/B test report is corresponded to two modules in Xiaomi A/B test platform and each module represents thousands of SQL query. Each report submits query tasks to the cluster where the two versions reside at the same concurrency. The test results are shown in the figure:\\n\\n![page_11](/images/xiaomi/en/page_11.jpg)\\n\\nCompared with Doris V0.13, Doris V1.1.2 reduces the overall average latency by around 52%. In the test, the query performance of Doris V1.1.2 version was more than 1 time higher than that of Doris V0.13. \\n\\n### Optimization in Test 3\\nTo verify the performance of the tuned Apache Doris V1.1.2 in other cases, we choose the Xiaomi user behavior analysis to conduct concurrent query performance tests of Doris V1.1.2 and Doris V0.13. We choose behavior analysis query for 4 days on October 24, 25, 26 and 27, 2022. The test results are shown in the figures:\\n\\n![page_12](/images/xiaomi/en/page_12.jpg)\\n\\nCompared with Doris V0.13, the overall average latency of Doris V1.1.2 has been reduced by about 77%, and the P95 latency has been reduced by about 83%. In this test, the query performance of Doris V1.1.2 version is 4~6 times higher than that of Doris V0.13.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\nSince we adopted Apache Doris in 2019, Apache Doris has currently served dozens of businesses and sub-brands within Xiaomi, with dozens of clusters and hundreds of nodes. It completes more than 10,000 user online analysis queries every day and is responsible for most of the online analysis in Xiaomi.\\n\\nAfter performance test and tuning, Apache Doris V1.1.2 has met the launch requirements of the Xiaomi A/B test platform and does well in query performance and stability. In some cases, it even exceeds our expectations, such as the overall average latency being reduced by about 77% in our tuned version.\\n\\nMeanwhile, some functions have in the above been released in Apache Doris V1.0 or V1.1,  some PRs have been merged into the community Master Fork and should be released soon. Recently the activity of the community has been greatly enhanceed. We are glad to see that Apache Doris has become more and more mature, and stepped forward to an integrated datalake. We truly believe that in the future, more data analysis will be explored and realized within Apache Doris.\\n\\n\\n# Contact Us\\nApache Doris Website\uff1ahttp://doris.apache.org\\n\\nGithub Homepage\uff1ahttps://github.com/apache/doris\\n\\nEmail to DEV\uff1adev@doris.apache.org"},{"id":"/release-1.2.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-1.2.0","source":"@site/blog/release-1.2.0.md","title":"Apache Doris announced the official release of version 1.2.0","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2022-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 7, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Release Notes","permalink":"/blog/tags/release-notes"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Apache Doris"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Apache Doris announced the official release of version 1.2.0","summary":"Dear community, we are pleased to announce that we have officially released Apache Doris 1.2.0 on December 7, 2022","date":"2022-12-7","author":"Apache Doris","tags":["Release Notes"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Practice and Optimization of Apache Doris in Xiaomi","permalink":"/blog/xiaomi_vector"},"nextItem":{"title":"JD.com\'s Exploration and Practice with Apache Doris in Realtime OLAP","permalink":"/blog/JD_OLAP"}},"content":"\x3c!--\\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\\nor more contributor license agreements.

Full Vectorizied-Engine support, greatly improved performance\\n\\n\\tIn the standard ssb-100-flat benchmark, the performance of 1.2 is 2 times faster than that of 1.1; in complex TPCH 100 benchmark, the performance of 1.2 is 3 times faster than that of 1.1.\\n\\n2. Merge-on-Write Unique Key\\n\\n\\tSupport Merge-On-Write on Unique Key Model. This mode marks the data that needs to be deleted or updated when the data is written, thereby avoiding the overhead of Merge-On-Read when querying, and greatly improving the reading efficiency on the updateable data model.\\n\\n3. Multi Catalog\\n\\n\\tThe multi-catalog feature provides Doris with the ability to quickly access external data sources for access. Users can connect to external data sources through the `CREATE CATALOG` command. Doris will automatically map the library and table information of external data sources. After that, users can access the data in these external data sources just like accessing ordinary tables. It avoids the complicated operation that the user needs to manually establish external mapping for each table.\\n   \\n    Currently this feature supports the following data sources:\\n   \\n    1. Hive Metastore: You can access data tables including Hive, Iceberg, and Hudi. It can also be connected to data sources compatible with Hive Metastore, such as Alibaba Cloud\'s DataLake Formation. Supports data access on both HDFS and object storage.\\n    2. Elasticsearch: Access ES data sources.\\n    3. JDBC: Access MySQL through the JDBC protocol.\\n   \\n    Documentation: https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/dev/ecosystem/external-table/multi-catalog)\\n\\n    > Note: The corresponding permission level will also be changed automatically, see the \\"Upgrade Notes\\" section for details.\\n   \\n4. Light table structure changes\\n\\nIn the new version, it is no longer necessary to change the data file synchronously for the operation of adding and subtracting columns to the data table, and only need to update the metadata in FE, thus realizing the millisecond-level Schema Change operation. Through this function, the DDL synchronization capability of upstream CDC data can be realized. For example, users can use Flink CDC to realize DML and DDL synchronization from upstream database to Doris.\\n\\nDocumentation: https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/dev/sql-manual/sql-reference/Data-Definition-Statements/Create/CREATE-TABLE\\n\\nWhen creating a table, set `\\"light_schema_change\\"=\\"true\\"` in properties.\\n\\n5. JDBC facade\\n\\n\\tUsers can connect to external data sources through JDBC. Currently supported:\\n\\n\\t  - MySQL\\n\\t  - PostgreSQL\\n\\t  - Oracle\\n\\t  - SQL Server\\n\\t  - Clickhouse\\n\\n\\tDocumentation: https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/dev/ecosystem/external-table/jdbc-of-doris/\\n\\n\\t> Note: The ODBC feature will be removed in a later version, please try to switch to the JDBC.\\n\\n6. JAVA UDF\\n\\n\\tSupports writing UDF/UDAF in Java, which is convenient for users to use custom functions in the Java ecosystem. At the same time, through technologies such as off-heap memory and Zero Copy, the efficiency of cross-language data access has been greatly improved.\\n\\n\\tDocument: https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/dev/ecosystem/udf/java-user-defined-function\\n\\n\\tExample: https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/samples/doris-demo\\n\\t\\n7. Remote UDF\\n\\n\\tSupports accessing remote user-defined function services through RPC, thus completely eliminating language restrictions for users to write UDFs. Users can use any programming language to implement custom functions to complete complex data analysis work.\\n\\n\\tDocumentation: https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/ecosystem/udf/remote-user-defined-function\\n\\n\\tExample: https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/samples/doris-demo\\n   \\n8. More data types support\\n\\n\\t- Array type\\n\\n\\t\\tArray types are supported. It also supports nested array types. In some scenarios such as user portraits and tags, the Array type can be used to better adapt to business scenarios. At the same time, in the new version, we have also implemented a large number of data-related functions to better support the application of data types in actual scenarios.\\n\\n\\tDocumentation: https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/dev/sql-manual/sql-reference/Data-Types/ARRAY\\n\\n\\tRelated functions: https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/dev/sql-manual/sql-functions/array-functions/array_max\\n        \\n\\t- Jsonb type\\n\\n\\t\\tSupport binary Json data type: Jsonb. This type provides a more compact json encoding format, and at the same time provides data access in the encoding format. Compared with json data stored in strings, it is several times newer and can be improved.\\n\\n\\tDocumentation: https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/dev/sql-manual/sql-reference/Data-Types/JSONB\\n\\n\\tRelated functions: https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/dev/sql-manual/sql-functions/json-functions/jsonb_parse\\n          \\n\\t- Date V2\\n\\t\\n\\t\\tSphere of influence:\\n\\n\\t\\t1. The user needs to specify datev2 and datetimev2 when creating the table, and the date and datetime of the original table will not be affected.\\n\\t\\t2. When datev2 and datetimev2 are calculated with the original date and datetime (for example, equivalent connection), the original type will be cast into a new type for calculation\\n\\t\\t3. The example is in the documentation\\n\\n\\t\\tDocumentation: https://doris.apache.org/docs/dev/sql-manual/sql-reference/Data-Types/DATEV2\\n\\t\\n\\t \\n## More\\n\\n1. A new memory management framework\\n\\n\\tDocumentation: https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/dev/admin-manual/maint-monitor/memory-management/memory-tracker\\n\\n2. Table Valued Function\\n\\n\\tDoris implements a set of Table Valued Function (TVF). TVF can be regarded as an ordinary table, which can appear in all places where \\"table\\" can appear in SQL.\\n\\n\\tFor example, we can use S3 TVF to implement data import on object storage:\\n\\n\\t```\\n\\tinsert into tbl select * from s3(\\"s3://bucket/file.*\\", \\"ak\\" = \\"xx\\", \\"sk\\" = \\"xxx\\") where c1 > 2;\\n\\t```\\n\\n\\tOr directly query data files on HDFS:\\n\\t\\n\\t```\\n\\tinsert into tbl select * from hdfs(\\"hdfs://bucket/file.*\\") where c1 > 2;\\n\\t```\\n\\t\\n\\tTVF can help users make full use of the rich expressiveness of SQL and flexibly process various data.\\n\\n    Documentation:\\n   \\n    https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/dev/sql-manual/sql-functions/table-functions/s3\\n   \\n    https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/dev/sql-manual/sql-functions/table-functions/hdfs\\n   \\n3.

The popularity of stream computing is increasing day by day: More papers are published on Google Dataflow; Apache Flink has become the one of the most popular engine in the world; There is wide application of real-time analytical databases more than ever before, such as Apache Doris; Stream computing engines are really flourishing. However, no engine is perfect enough to solve every problem. It is important to find a  suitable OLAP engine for the business. We hope that JD.com\'s practice in  real-time OLAP and stream computing may give you some inspiration.\\n\\n>Author: Li Zhe, data engineer of JD.com, who focused on offline data, stream computing and application development.\\n\\n## About JD.com\\nJD.com (NASDAQ: JD), a leading e-commerce company in China, had a net income of RMB 951.6 billion in 2021. JD Group owns JD Retail, JD Global, JD Technology, JD Logistics, JD Cloud, etc. Jingdong Group was officially listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange in May 2014.\\n\\n## JD Search Box\'s Requirement: Real-time Data Analysis\\nJD search box, as the entrance of the e-commerce platform, provides a link betwee merchants and users. Users can express their needs through the search box. In order to better understand user intentions and quickly improve the conversion rate, multiple A/B tests are running online at the same time, which apply to multiple products. The category, organization, and brand all need to be monitored online for better conversion. At present, JD search box demands real-time data in application mainly includes three parts:\\n\\n1. The overall data of JD search box.\\n2. Real-time monitoring of the A/B test.\\n3. Top list of hot search words to reflect changes in public opinion. Words trending can reflect what users care\\n\\nThe analysis mentioned above needs to refine the data to the SKU-level. At the same time, we also undertake the task of building a real-time data platform to show our business analysists different real-time stream computing data.\\n\\nAlthough different business analysists care about different data granularity, time frequency, and dimensions, we are hoping to establish a unified real-time OLAP data warehouse and provide a set of safe, reliable and flexible real-time data services.\\n\\nAt present, the newly generated exposure logs every day reach hundreds of millions. The logs willl increase by 10 times if they are stored as SKU. And they would grow to billions of records if based on A/B test. Aggregation queries cross multi-dimension require second-level response time. \\n\\nSuch an amount of data also brings huge challenges to the team: 2 billion rows have been created daily; Up to 60 million rows need to be imported per minute; Data latency should be limited to 1 minute; MDX query needs to be executed within 3 seconds; QPS has reached above 20. Yet a new reliable OLAP database with high stability should be able to respond to priority 0 emergency.\\n\\n## The Evolution of the Real-time Architecture\\nOur previous architecture is based on Apache Storm for a point-to-point data processing. This approach can quickly meet the needs of real-time reports during the stage of rapid business growth in the early days. However, with the continuous development of business, disadvantages gradually appear. For example, poor flexibility, poor data consistency, low development efficiency and increased resource costs.\\n\\n![page_2](/images/jd/en/page_2.png)\\n\\nIn order to solve the problems of the previous architecture, we first upgraded the architecture and replaced Apache Storm with Apache Flink to achieve high throughput. At the same time, according to the characteristics of the search data, the real-time data is processed hierarchically, which means the PV data flow, the SKU data flow and the A/B test data flow are created. It is expected to build the upper real-time OLAP layer based on the real-time flow.\\n\\nWhen selecting OLAP database, the following points need to be considered:\\n\\n1. The data latency is at minute-level and the query response time is at second-level\\n2. Suppots standard SQL, which reduces the cost of use\\n3. Supports JOIN to facilitate adding dimension\\n4. Traffic data can be deduplicated approximately, but order data must be exact deduplicated \\n5. High throughput with tens of millions of records per minute and tens of billions of new records every day\\n6. Query concurrency needs to be high because Front-end may need it\\n\\nBy comparing the OLAP engines that support real-time import , we made an in-depth comparison among Apache Druid, Elasticsearch, Clickhouse and Apache Doris:\\n\\n![page_3](/images/jd/en/page_3.png)\\n\\n\\nWe found out that Doris and Clickhouse can meet our needs. But the concurrency of Clickhouse is low for us, which is a potential risk. Moreover, the data import of Clickhouse has no TRANSACTION and cannot achieve Exactly-once semantics. Clickhouse is not fully supportive of SQL.\\n\\n\\nFinally, we chose Apache Doris as our real-time OLAP database. For user behavior log data, we use Aggregation Key data table; As for E-commerce orders data, we use Unique Key data table. Moreover, we split the previous tasks and reuse the logic we tried before. Therefore, when Flink is processing, there will be new topic flow and real-time flow of different granularities generated in DWD. The new architecture is as follows:\\n\\n![page_4](/images/jd/en/page_4.png)\\n\\nIn the current technical architecture, flink task is very light. Based on the production data detail layer, we directly use Doris to act as the aggregation layer function.  And we ask Doris to complete window calculation which previously belongs to Flink. We also take advantage of the routine load to consume real-time data. Although the data is fine-grained before importing, based on the Aggregation Key, asynchronous aggregation will be automatically performed. The degree of aggregation is completely determined by the number of dimensions. By creating Rollup on the base table, double-write or multi-write and pre-aggregate operations are performed during import, which is similar to the function of materialized view, which can highly aggregate data to improve query performance.\\n\\nAnother advantage of using Kafka to directly connect to Doris at the detail layer is that it naturally supports data backtracking. Data backtracking means that when real-time data is out of order, the \\"late\\" data can be recalculated and the previous results can be updated. This is because delayed data can be written to the table whenever it arrives. The final solution is as follows:\\n\\n![page_5](/images/jd/en/page_5.png)\\n\\n## Optimization during the Promotion\\nAs mentioned above, we have established Aggregation Key of different granularities in Doris, including PV, SKU, and A/B test granularity. Here we take the exposure A/B test model with the largest amount of daily production data as an example to explain how to support the query of tens of billions of records per day during the big promotion period.\\n\\nStrategy we used:\\n- Monitoring: 10, 30, 60 minutes A/B test with indicators, such as exposure PV, UV, exposure SKU pieces, click PV, click UV and CTR.\\n- Data Modeling: Use exposed real-time data to establish Aggregation Key; And perform HyperLogLog approximate calculation with UV and PV\\n\\nClusters we had:\\n- 30+ virtual machines with storage of NVMe SSD\\n- 40+ partitions exposed by A/B test\\n- Tens of billions of new data are created every day\\n- 2 Rollups\\n\\nBenefits overall:\\n- Bucket Field can quickly locate tablet partition when querying\\n- Import 600 million records in 10 minutes\\n- 2 Rollups have relatively low IO, which meet the requirement of the query\\n\\n## Look Ahead\\nJD search box introduced Apache Doris in May 2020, with a scale of 30+ BEs, 10+ routine load tasks running online at the same time. Replacing Flink\'s window computing with Doris can not only improve development efficiency, adapt to dimension changes, but also reduce computing resources. Apache Doris provides unified interface services ensuring data consistency and security.\\nWe are also pushing the upgrade of JD search box\'s OLAP platform to the latest version. After upgrading, we plan to use the bitmap function to support accurate deduplication operations of UV and other indicators. In addition, we also plan to use the appropriate Flink window to develop the real-time stream computing of the aggregation layer to increase the richness and completeness of the data."},{"id":"/Netease","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Netease","source":"@site/blog/Netease.md","title":"Apache Doris Helped Netease Create a Refined Operation DMP System","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2022-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 30, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Best Practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/best-practice"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Liu"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Apache Doris Helped Netease Create a Refined Operation DMP System","summary":"Better data analysis enables users to get better experience.

In this article, you will get knowledge of: the construction of Netease Lifease\'s DMP system and the application of Apache Doris.\\n\\n> Author | Xiaodong Liu, Lead Developer, Netease\\n\\n\\nBetter data analysis enables users to get better experience. Currently, the normal analysis method is to build a user tags system to accurately generate user portraits and improve user experience. The topic we shared today is the practice of Netease DMP tags system.\\n\\n## About Netease and Lifease\\nNetEase (NASDAQ: NTES) is a leading Internet technology company in China, providing users with free emails, gaming, search engine services, news and entertainment, sports, e-commerce and other services.\\n\\nLifease is Netease\'s self-operated home furnishing e-commerce brand. Its products cover 8 categories in total: home life, apparel, food and beverages, personal care and cleaning, baby products, outdoor sport, digital home appliances, and Lifease\'s Special. In Q1 of 2022, Lifease launches \\"Pro \\" membership and other multiple memberships for different users. The number of Pro members has increased by 65% \u200b\u200bcompared with the previous year.\\n\\n## About the DMP System\\nDMP system plays an important role in Lifease\'s data analysis. \\nThe data sources of DMP mainly include:\\n- Business logs of APPs, H5s, PCs and other terminals\\n- Basic data constructed within NetEase Group\\n- Data from products sold by third-party such as JD.com, Alibaba, and Bytedance\\nThrough data collection and data cleaning, the above data is ingested into data assets. Based on these data, DMP has created a system of functions, such as tag creation, grouping and portrait analysis, which supports the business including: intelligent product matching, user engagement, and user insight. In general, the DMP system concentrates on building a data-centric tagging system and portrait system to assist the business.\\n\\nYou can get basic knowledge of the DMP system starting from the concepts below:\\n- Tagging: Tagging is one of the user monitoring abilities to uniquely identify individual users across different browsers, devices, and user sessions. This approach to user tagging works by capturing available data in your application\'s page source: age, address, preference and other variables. \\n- Targeting: Target audience may be dictated by age, gender, income, location, interests or a myriad of other factors.\\n- User Portrait Analysis: User portrait analysis is to develop user profiles, actions and attributes after targeting audience. For instance, check the behavior paths and consumption models of users whose portraits are \\"City: Hangzhou, Gender: Female\\" on Lifease APP.\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/1__core_capability.png)\\n\\nLlifease\'s tagging system mainly provides two core capabilities: \\n1. Tag Query: the ability to query the specified tag of a specific entity, which is often used to display basic information. \\n2. Targeting Audience: for both real-time and offline targets. Result after targeting is mainly used for:\\n- As Grouping Criteria: It can be used to tell if the user is in one or more specified groups. This occasionally occurs in scenarios such as advertising and contact marketing. \\n- Resultset Pull: Extract specified data to business system for customized development.\\n- Portrait Analysis: Analyze the behavioral and consumption models in specific groups of people for more refined operations.\\n\\nThe overall business process is as follows:\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/2__business_process.png)\\n\\n- First define the rules for tags and grouping;\\n- After defining the DSL, the task can be submitted to Spark for processing;\\n- After the processing is done, the results can be stored in Hive and Doris;\\n- Data from Hive or Doris can be queried and used according to the actual business needs.\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/3__dmp_architecture.png)\\n\\nThe DMP platform is divided into four modules: Processing&storage layer, scheduling layer, service layer, and metadata management.\\nAll tag meta-information is stored in the source data table; The scheduling layer schedules tasks for the entire business process: Data processing and aggregation are converted into basic tags, and the data in the basic tags and source tables are converted into something that can be used for data query through SQL; The scheduling layer dispatches tasks to Spark to process, and then stores results in both Hive and Doris. The service layer consists of four parts: tag service, entity grouping service, basic tag data service, and portrait analysis service.\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/4__tag_lifecycle.png)\\n\\nThe lifecycle of tag consists of 5 phases:\\n- Tag requirements: At this stage, the operation team demands and the product manager team evaluates the rationality and urgency of the requirements.\\n- Scheduling production: Developers first sort out the data from ODS to DWD, which is the entire link of DM layer. Secondly, they build a model based on data, and at the same time, monitor the production process.\\n- Targeting Audience: After the tag is produced, group the audience by those tags.\\n- Precision marketing: Carry out precision marketing strategy to people grouped by.\\n- Effect evaluation: In the end, tage usage rate and use effect need to be evaluated for future optimization.\\n\\n## Production of Tags\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/5__production_of_tags.png)\\n\\nTag data layering:\\n- The bottom layer is the ODS layer, including user login logs, event tracking records, transaction data, and Binlog data of various databases\\n- The data processed by the ODS layer, such as user login table, user activity table and order information table reaches the DWD detail layer\\n- The DWD layer data is aggregated to the DM layer and the tags are all implemented based on the DM layer data.\\nAt present, we have fully automated the data output from the original database to the ODS layer. And we also realized partial automation from the ODS layer to the DWD layer. And there are a small number of automated operations from the DWD to the DM layer, which will be our focus in the future.\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/6__type_of__tags.png)\\n\\nTags are devided based on timeliness: offline tags, quasi-real-time tags and real-time tags. According to the scale of data, it is divided into: aggregation tags and detail tags. In other cases, tags can also be divided into: account attribute tags, consumption behavior tags, active behavior tags, user preference tags, asset information tags, etc. \\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/7__tags_settings.png)\\n\\nIt is inconvenient to use the data of the DM layer directly because the basic data is relatively primitive. The abstraction level is lacking and it is not easy to use. By combining basic data with AND, OR, and NOT, business tags are formed for further use, which can reduce the cost of understanding operations and make it easier to use.\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/8__target_audience.png)\\n\\nAfter the tags are merged, it is necessary to apply the tags to specific business scenarios, such as grouping. The configuration is shown on the left side of the figure above, which supports offline crowd packages and real-time behaviors (need to be configured separately). After configuration, generate the DSL rules shown on the right side of the figure above, expressed in Json format, which is more friendly to FE, and can also be converted into query statements of the datebase engine.\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/9__target_audience-mapping.png)\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/10__automation.png)\\n\\nTagging is partially automated. The degree of automation in grouping is relatively high. For example, group refresh can be done regularly every day; Advanced processing, such as intersection/merge/difference between groups; Data cleaning means timely cleaning up expired and invalid data.\\n\\n## Tags Storage\\nLifease\'s DMP labeling system needs to carry relatively large customer end traffic, and has relatively high requirements for real-time performance. Our storage requirements include:\\n- Need support high-performance query to deal with large-scale customer end traffic\\n- Need support SQL to facilitate data analysis scenarios\\n- Need support data update mechanism\\n- Can store large amount of data\\n- Need support for extension functions to handle custom data structures\\n- Closely integrated with big data ecology\\n\\nIn the field of big data, multiple engines vary in different applicable scenarios. We used the popular engines in the chart below to optimize our database architecture for 2 times.\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/11__comparision.png)\\n\\nOur architecture V1.0 is shown below:\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/12__architecture_v1_0.png)\\n\\nMost of the offline data is stored in Hive while a small part is stored in Hbase (mainly used for querying basic tags). Part of the real-time data is stored in Hbase for basic tags query and the rest is double-written into KUDU and Elasticsearch for real-time grouping and data query. The data offline is processed by Impala and cached in Redis. \\nDisadvantages :\\n- Too many database engines.\\n- Double writing has hidden problems with data quality. One side may succeed while the other side fails, resulting in data inconsistency.\\n- The project is complex and maintainability is poor.\\nIn order to reduce the usage of engine and storage, we improved and implemented version 2.0 :\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/13__architecture_v2_0.png)\\n\\nIn storage architecture V2.0, Apache Doris is adopted. Offline data is mainly stored in Hive. At the same time, basic tags are imported into Doris, and real-time data as well. The query federation of Hive and Doris is performed based on Spark, and the results are stored in Redis. After this improvement, an storage engine which can manages offline and real-time data has been created. We are currently use Apache Doris 1.0, which enables : 1. The query performance can be controlled within 20ms at 99% 2.  The query performance can be controlled within 50ms at 99.9%.  Now the architecture is simplified, which greatly reduces operation and maintenance costs.\\n\\n## Advantages of Apache Doris in Practice\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/14__advantages_in_practice.png)\\n\\nLifeuse has adopted Apache Doris to check, batch query, path analyse and grouping. The advantages are as follows:\\n- The query federation performance of  key query and a small number of tables exceeds 10,000 QPS, with RT99<50MS.\\n- The horizontal expansion capability is relatively strong and maintenance cost is relatively low.\\n- The offlin and real-time data are unified to reduce the complexity of the tags model.\\n\\nThe downside is that importing a large amount of small data takes up more resources. But this problem has been optimized in Doris 1.1. Apache Doris has greatly enhanced the data compaction capability in version 1.1, and can quickly complete aggregation of new data, avoiding the -235 error caused by too many versions of sharded data and the low query efficiency problems.\\n\\n## Future Plan\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/netease/15__future_plan.png)\\n\\nHive and Spark are gradually turning into Apache Doris. \\nOptimize the tagging system:\\n- Establish a rich and accurate tag evaluation system\\n- Improve tag quality and output speed\\n- Improve tag coverage\\nMore precision operation:\\n- Build a rich user analysis model\\n- Improve the user insight model evaluation system based on the frequency of use and user value\\n- Establish general image analysis capabilities to assist intelligent decision-making in operations"},{"id":"/NIO","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/NIO","source":"@site/blog/NIO.md","title":"The Application of Apache Doris in NIO","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2022-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 28, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Best Practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/best-practice"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Huaidong Tang"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"The Application of Apache Doris in NIO","summary":"NIO Inc.

Founded in November 2014, NIO designs, develops, jointly manufactures and sells premium smart electric vehicles, driving innovations in autonomous driving, digital technologies, electric powertrains and batteries.\\n\\nRecently, NIO planned to enter the U.S. market alongside other western markets by the end of 2025. The company has already established a U.S. headquarters in San Jose, California, where they started hiring people.\\n\\n## The Architecture Evolution of OLAP in NIO\\n\\nThe architectural evolution of OLAP in NIO took several steps for years.\\n\\n### 1. Introduced Apache Druid\\n\\nAt that time, there were not so many OLAP storage and query engines to choose from. The more common ones were Apache Druid and Apache Kylin. There are 2 reasons why we didn\'t choose Kylin.\\n\\n- The most suitable and optimal storage at the bottom of Kylin is HBase and adding it would increase the cost of operation and maintenance.\\n\\n- Kylin\'s precalculation involves various dimensions and indicators. Too many dimensions and indicators would cause great pressure on storage.\\n\\nWe prefer Druid because we used to be users and are familiar with it. Apache Druid has obvious advantages. It supports real-time and offline data import, columnar storage, high concurrency, and high query efficiency. But it has downsides as well:\\n\\n- Standard protocols such as JDBC are not used\\n\\n- The capability of JOIN is weak\\n\\n- Significant performance downhill when performing dedeplication\\n\\n- High in operation and maintenance costs, different components have separate installation methods and different dependencies; Data import needs extra integration with Hadoop and the dependencies of JAR packages\\n\\n### 2. Introduced TiDB\\n\\n**TiDB is a mature datawarehouse focused on OLTP+OLAP, which also has distinctive advantages and disadvantages:**\\n\\nAdvantage:\\n\\n- OLTP database, can be updated friendly\\n\\n- Supports detailed and aggregated query, which can handle dashboard statistical reports or query of detailed data at the same time\\n\\n- Supports standard SQL, which has low cost of use\\n\\n- Low operation and maintenance cost\\n\\nDisadvantages:\\n\\n- It is not an independent OLAP. TiFlash relies on OLTP and will increase storage. Its OLAP ability is insufficient\\n\\n- The overall performance should be measured separately by each scene\\n\\n### 3. Introduced Apache Doris\\n\\nSince 2021, we have officially introduced Apache Doris. In the process of selection, we are most concerned about various factors such as product performance, SQL protocol, system compatibility, learning and operation and maintenance costs. After deep research and detailed comparison of the following systems, we came to the following conclusions:\\n\\n**Apache Doris, whose advantages fully meet our demands:**\\n\\n- Supports high concurrent query (what we concerned most)\\n\\n- Supports both real-time and offline data\\n\\n- Supports detailed and aggregated query\\n\\n- UNIQ model can be updated\\n\\n- The ability of Materialized View can greatly speed up query efficiency\\n\\n- Fully compatible with the MySQL protocol and the cost of development is relatively low\\n\\n- The performance fully meets our requirements\\n\\n- Lower operation and maintenance costs\\n\\n**Moreover, there is another competitor, Clickhouse. Its stand-alone performance is extremely strong, but its disadvantages are hard to accept:**\\n\\n- In some cases, its multi-table JOIN is weak\\n\\n- Relatively low in concurrency\\n\\n- High operation and maintenance costs\\n\\nWith multiple good performances, Apache Doris outstands Druid and TiDB. Meanwhile Clickhouse did not fit well in our business, which lead us to Apache Doris.\\n\\n## Apache Doris-the Unified OLAP Datawarehouse\\n![NIO](/images/olap.png)\\n\\nThis diagram basically describes our OLAP Architecuture, including data source, data import, data processing, data warehouse, data service and application.\\n\\n### 1. Data Source\\n\\nIn NIO, the data source not only refers to database, but also event tracking data, device data, vehicle data, etc. The data will be ingested into the big data platform. \\n### 2. Data Import\\n\\nFor business data, you can trigger CDC and convert it into a data stream, store it in Kafka, and then perform stream processing. Some data that can only be passed in batches will directly enter our distributed storage.\\n\\n### 3. Data Processing\\n\\nWe took the Lambda architecture rather than stream-batch integration.\\n\\nOur own business determines that our Lambda architecture should be divided into two paths: offline and real-time:\\n\\n- Some data is streamed.\\n\\n- Some data can be stored in the data stream, and some historical data will not be stored in Kafka.\\n\\n- Some data requires high precision in some circumstances. In order to ensure the accuracy of the data, an offline pipeline will recalculate and refresh the entire data.\\n\\n### 4. Data Warehouse\\n\\nFrom data processing to the data warehouse, we did not adopt Flink or Spark Doris Connector. We use Routine Load to connect Apache Doris and Flink, and Broker Load to connect Doris and Spark. The data generated in batches by Spark will be backed up to Hive for further use in other scenarios. In this way, each calculation is used for multiple scenarios at the same time, which greatly improves the efficiency. It also works for Flink.\\n\\n### 5. Data Service\\n\\nWhat behind Doris is One Service. By registering the data source or flexible configuration, the API with flow and authority control is automatically generated, which greatly improves flexibility. And with the k8s serverless solution, the entire service is much more flexible.\\n\\n### 6. Application\\n\\nIn the application layer, we mainly deploy some reporting applications and other services.\\n\\nWe mainly have two types of scenarios:\\n\\n- **User-oriented** , which is similar to the Internet, contains a data dashboard and data indicators.\\n\\n- **Car-oriented** , car data enters Doris in this way. After certain aggregation, the volume of Doris data is about billions. But the overall performance can still meet our requirements.\\n\\n## Best Practice of Apache Doris on CDP Architecture\\n\\n### 1. CDP Architecture\\n\\n![NIO](/images/cdp.png)\\n\\nNext, let me introduce Doris\' practice on the operating platform. This is what happens in our real business. Nowadays, Internet companies will make their own CDP, which includes several modules:\\n\\n- **Tags** , which is the most basic part.\\n\\n- **Target** , based on tags, select people according to some certain logic.\\n\\n- **Insight** , aiming at a group of people, clarify the distribution and characteristics of the group.\\n\\n- **Touch** , use methods such as text messages, phone calls, voices, APP notifications, IM, etc. to reach users, and cooperate with flow control.\\n\\n- **Effect analysis,** to improve the integrity of the operation platform, with action, effect and feedback.\\n\\nDoris plays the most important role here, including: tags storage, groups storage, and effect analysis.\\n\\nTags are divided into basic tags and basic data of user behavior. We can flexibly customize other tags based on those facts. From the perspective of time effectiveness, tags are also divided into real-time tags and offline tags.\\n\\n### 2. Considerations for CDP Storage Selection\\n\\nWe took five dimensions into account when we select CDP storage.\\n\\n**(1) Unification of Offline and Real-time**\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, there are offline tags and real-time tags. Currently we are close to quasi-real-time. For some data, quasi-real-time is good enough to meet our needs. A large number of tags are still offline tags. The methods used are Doris\'s Routine Load and Broker Load.\\n\\n| **Scenes** | **Requirements** | **Apache Doris\'s Function** |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Real-time tags | Real-time data updates | Routine Load |\\n| Offline tags | Highly efficient batch import | Broker Load |\\n| Unification of offline and real-time | Unification of offline and real-time data storage | Routine Load and Broker Load update different columns of the same table |\\n\\nIn addition, on the same table, the update frequency of different columns is also different. For example, we need to update the user\'s identity in real time because the user\'s identity changes all the time. T+1\'s update does not meet our needs. Some tags are offline, such as the user\'s gender, age and other basic tags, T+1 update is sufficient to meet our standards. The maintenance cost caused by putting the tags of basic users on the same table is very low. When customizing tags later, the number of tables will be greatly reduced, which benefits the overall performance.\\n\\n**(2) Efficient Targets**\\n\\nWhen users tags are done, is time to target right group of people. The target is to filter out all the people who meet the conditions according to different combinations of tags. At this time, there will be queries with different combinations of tag conditions. There was an obvious improvement when Apache Doris upgraded to vectorization.\\n\\n| **Scenes** | **Requirements** | **Apache Doris\'s Function** |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Complex Condition Targets | Highly efficient combination of tags | Optimization of SIMD |\\n\\n**(3) Efficient Polymerization**\\n\\nThe user insights and effect analysis statistics mentioned above require statistical analysis of the data, which is not a simple thing of obtaining tags by user ID. The amount of data read and query efficiency have a great impact on the distribution of our tags, the distribution of groups, and the statistics of effect analysis. Apache Doris helps a lot:\\n\\n- Data Partition. We shard the data by time order and the analysis and statistics will greatly reduce the amount of data, which can greatly speed up the efficiency of query and analysis.\\n\\n- Node aggregation. Then we collect them for unified aggregation.\\n\\n- Vectorization. The vectorization execution engine has significant performance improvement.\\n\\n| **Scenes** | **Requirements** | **Apache Doris\'s Function** |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Distribution of Tags Values | The distribution values \u200b\u200bof all tags need to be updated every day. Fast and efficient statistics are required  | Data partition lessens data transfer and calculation |\\n| Distribution of Groups | Same as Above | Unified storage and calculation, each node aggregates first |\\n| Statistics for Performance Analysis | Same as Above | Speed up SIMD\\n\\n\\n**(4) Multi-table Association**\\n\\nOur CDP might be different from common CDP scenarios in the industry, because common CDP tags in some scenarios are estimated in advance and no custom tags, which leaves the flexibility to users who use CDP to customize tags themselves. The underlying data is scattered in different database tables. If you want to create a custom tag, you must associate the tables.\\n\\nA very important reason we chose Doris is the ability to associate multiple tables. Through performance tests, Apache Doris is able to meet our requirements. And Doris provides users with powerful capabilities because tags are dynamic.\\n\\n| **Scenes** | **Requirements** | **Apache Doris\'s Function** |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Distributed Characteristics of the Population | The distribution of statistical groups under a certain characteristic | Table Association |\\n| Single Tag | Display tags |\\n\\n**(5) Query Federation**\\n\\nWhether the user is successfully reached or not will be recorded in TiDB. Notifications during operations may only affect user experience. If a transaction is involved, such as gift cards or coupons, the task execution must be done without repetition. TiDB is more suitable for this OLTP scenario.\\n\\nBut for effect analysis, it is necessary to understand the extent to which the operation plan is implemented, whether the goal is achieved and its distribution. It is necessary to combine task execution and group selection for analysis, which requires the query association between Doris and TiDB.\\n\\nThe size of the tag is probably small, so we would like to save it into Elasticsearch. However, it proves us wrong later.\\n\\n| **Scenes** | **Requirements** | **Apache Doris\'s Function** |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Effect Analysis Associated with Execution Details | Doris query associated with TiDB | Query Association with other databases |\\n| Group Tags Associated with Behavior Aggregation | Doris query associated with Elasticsearch |\\n\\n## Summery and Benefits\\n\\n1. **bitmap**. Our volume are not big enough to test its full efficiency. If the volume reaches a certain level, using bitmap might have a good performance improvement. For example, when calculating UV , bitmap aggregation can be considered if the full set of Ids is greater than 50 million.\\n\\n2. **The performance is good** when Elasticsearch single-table query is associated with Doris.\\n\\n3. **Better to update columns in batches**. In order to reduce the number of tables and improve the performance of the JOIN table, the table designed should be as streamlined as possible and aggregated as much as possible. However, fields of the same type may have different update frequencies. Some fields need to be updated at daily level, while others may need to be updated at hourly level. Updating a column alone is an important requirement. The solution from Apache Doris is to use REPLACE\\\\_IF\\\\_NOT\\\\_NULL. Note: It is impossible to replace the original non-null value with null. You can replace all nulls with meaningful default values, such as unknown.\\n\\n4. **Online Services**.

Reling on its flexible query model, extremely low maintenance costs, high development efficiency, and excellent query performance, Apache Doris has been used in many business scenarios such as real-time business operations, AI chatbots analysis. It meets various data analysis needs such as device portrait/user label, real-time operation, data dashboard, self-service BI and financial reconciliation. And now I will share our experience through this article.\\n\\nAuthor\uff5cZhao Wei, Head Developer of AISPEACH\'s Big Data Departpment\\n\\n## Backgounds\\n\\nAISPEACH is a professional conversational artificial intelligence company in China. It has full-link intelligent voice and language technology. It is committed to becoming a platform-based enterprise for full-link intelligent voice and language interaction. Recently it has developed a new generation of human-computer interaction platform DUI and artificial intelligence chip TH1520, providing natural language interaction solutions for partners in many industry scenarios such as Internet of Vehicles, IoT, government affairs and fintech.\\n\\nAspire introduced Apache Doris for the first time in 2019 and built a real-time and offline data warehouse based on Apache Doris. Compared with the previous architecture, Apache Doris has many advantages such as flexible query model, extremely low maintenance cost, high development efficiency and excellent query performance. Multiple business scenarios have been applied to meet various data analysis needs such as device portraits/user tags, real-time operation of business scenarios, data analysis dashboards, self-service BI, and financial reconciliation.\\n\\n## Architecture Evolution\\n\\nOffline data analysis in the early business was our main requirement. Recently, with the continuous development of business, the requirements for real-time data analysis in business scenarios have become higher and higher. The early datawarehouse architecture failed to meet our requirements. In order to meet the higher requirements of business scenarios for query performance, response time, and concurrency capabilities, Apache Doris was officially introduced in 2019 to build a real-time and offline integrated datawarehouse architecture.\\n\\nIn the following I will introduce the evolution of the AISPEACH Data Warehouse architecture, and share the reasons why we chose Apache Doris to build a new architecture.\\n\\n### Early Data Warehouse Architecture\\n\\nAs shown in the architecture diagram below, the offline data warehouse is based on Hive + Kylin while the real-time data warehouse is based on Spark + MySQL.\\n\\n![data_wharehouse_architecture_v1_0_git](/images/data_wharehouse_architecture_v1_0_git.png)\\n\\nThere are three main types of data sources in our business, business databases such as MySQL, application systems such as K8s container service logs, and logs of automotive T-Box. Data sources are first written to Kafka through various methods such as MQTT/HTTP protocol, business database Binlog, and Filebeat log collection. In the early time, the data will be divided into real-time and offline links after passing through Kafka. Real-time part has a shorter link. The data buffered by Kafka is processed by Spark and put into MySQL for further analysis. MySQL can basically meet the early analysis requirements. After data cleaning and processing by Spark, an offline datawarehouse is built in Hive, and Apache Kylin is used to build Cube. Before building Cube, it is necessary to design the data model in advance, including association tables, dimension tables, index fields, and aggregation functions. After construction through the scheduling system, we can finally use HBase to store the Cube.\\n\\n#### Pain Points of Early Architecture\uff1a\\n\\n1. **There are many dependent components.** Kylin strongly relies on Hadoop and HBase in versions 2.x and 3.x. The large number of application components leads to low development efficiency, many hidden dangers of architecture stability, and high maintenance costs.\\n\\n2. **The construction process of Kylin is complicated and the construction task always fail.** When we do construction for Kylin, we always need to do the following: widen tables, de-duplicate columns, generate dictionaries, build cubes, etc. If there are 1000-2000 or more tasks per day, at least 10 or more tasks will fail to build, resulting in a lot of time to write automatic operation and maintenance scripts.\\n\\n3. **Dimension/dictionary expansion is heavy.** Dimension expansion refers to the need for multiple analysis conditions and fields in some business scenarios. If many fields are selected in the data analysis model without pruning, it will lead to severe cube dimension expansion and longer construction time. Dictionary inflation means that in some scenarios, it takes a long time to do global accurate deduplication, which will make the dictionary construction bigger and bigger, and the construction time will become longer and longer, resulting in a continuous decline in data analysis performance.\\n\\n4. **The data analysis model is fixed and low in flexibility.** In the actual application, if a calculation field or business scenario is changed, some or even all of the data needs to be backtracked.\\n\\n5. **Data detail query is not supported.** The early data warehouse architecture could not provide detailed data query. The official Kylin solution is to relate to Presto for detailed query, which introduces another architecture and increases development costs.\\n\\n### Architecture Selection\\n\\nIn order to solve the problems above, we began to explore other datawarehouse architecture solutions. And we conducted a series of research on OLAP engines such as Apache Doris and Clickhouse, which are most widely used in the market.\\n\\nAs the original creator, SelectDB provides commercial support and services for Apache Doris. With the new Apache Doris, SelectDB is now providing global users with a fully-managed database option for deployment.\\n\\nComparing with ClickHouse\'s heavy maintenance, various table types, and lack of support for associated queries, Apache Doris performed better. And combined with our OLAP analysis scenario, we finally decided to introduce Apache Doris.\\n\\n### New Data Warehouse Architecture\\n\\n![data_wharehouse_architecture_v2_0_git](/images/data_wharehouse_architecture_v2_0_git.png)\\n\\nAs shown in the figure above, we built a new real-time + offline data warehouse architecture based on Apache Doris. Unlike the previous architecture, real-time and offline data are processed separately and written to Apache Doris for analysis.\\n\\nDue to some historical reasons, data migration is difficult. The offline data is basically consistent with the previous datawarehouse architecture, and it is entirely possible to directly build an offline data warehouse on Apache Doris.\\n\\nComparing with the earlier architecture, the offline data is cleaned and processed by Spark, which is possible to build data warehouse in Hive. Then the data stored in Hive can be written to Apache Doris through Broker Load. What I want to explain here is that the data import speed of Broker Load is very fast and it only takes 10-20 minutes to import 100-200G data into Apache Doris on a daily basis.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the real-time data flow, the new architecture uses Doris-Spark-Connector to consume data in Kafka and write it to Apache Doris after simple tasks. As shown in the architecture diagram, real-time and offline data are analyzed and processed in Apache Doris, which meets the business requirements of data applications for both real-time and offline.\\n\\n#### Benefits of the New Architecture:\\n\\n1. **Simplified operation, low maintenance cost, and does not depend on Hadoop ecological components.** The deployment of Apache Doris is simple. There are only two processes of FE and BE. Both FE and BE processes can be scaled out. A single cluster supports hundreds of machines and tens of PB storage capacity. These two types of processes pass the consistency agreement to ensure high availability of services and high reliability of data. This highly integrated architecture design greatly reduces the operation and maintenance cost of a distributed system. The operation and maintenance time spent in the three years of using Doris is very small. Comparing with the previous architecture based on Kylin, the new architecture spends little time on operation and maintenance.\\n\\n2. **The difficulty of developing and troubleshooting problems is greatly reduced.** The real-time and offline unified data warehouse based on Doris supports real-time data services, interactive data analysis, and offline data processing scenarios, which greatly reduces the difficulty of troubleshooting.\\n\\n3. **Apache Doris supports JOIN query in Runtime format.** Runtime is similar to MySQL\'s table association, which is friendly to the scene where the data analysis model changes frequently, and solves the problem of low flexibility in the early structured data model.\\n\\n4. **Apache Doris supports JOIN, aggregation, and detailed query at the same time.** Meanwhile, it solves the problem that data details could not be queried in the previous architecture.\\n\\n5. **Apache Doris supports multiple accelerated query methods.** And it also supports rollup index, materialized view, and implements secondary index through rollup index to speed up query, which greatly improves query response time.\\n\\n6. **Apache Doris supports multiple types of Query Federation.** And it supports Federation Query analysis on data lakes such as Hive, Iceberg, and Hudi, and also databases such as MySQL and Elasticsearch.\\n\\n## Applications\\n\\nApache Doris was first applied in real-time business and AI Chatbots analysis scenarios in AISPEACH. This chapter will introduce the requirements and applications of the two scenarios.\\n\\n### Real-time Business\\n\\n![real-time_operation_git](/images/real-time_operation_git.png)\\n\\nAs shown in the figure above, the technical architecture of the real-time operation business is basically the same as the new version of the data warehouse architecture mentioned above:\\n\\n- Data Source: The data source is consistent in the new version with the architecture diagram in the new version, including business data in MySQL, event tracking data of the application system, device and terminal logs.\\n\\n- Data Import: Broker Load is used for offline data import, and Doris-Spark-Connector is used for real-time data import.\\n\\n- Data Storage and Development: Almost all real-time data warehouses are built on Apache Doris, and some offline data is placed on Airflow to perform DAG batch tasks.\\n\\n- Data Application: The top layer is the business analysis requirements, including large-screen display, real-time dashboard for data operation, user portrait, BI tools, etc.\\n\\n**In real-time operation business, there are two main requirements for data analysis:**\\n\\n- Due to the large amount of real-time imported data, the query efficiency requirement is high.\\n\\n- In this scenario, a team of 20+ people is in charge. The data operation dashboard needs to be opened at the same time, so there will be relatively high requirements for real-time writing performance and query concurrency.\\n\\n### AI Chatbots Analysis\\n\\nIn addition, the second application of Apache Doris in AISPEACG is a AI Chatbots analysis.\\n\\n![ai_chatbots_git](/images/ai_chatbots_git.png)\\n\\nAs shown in the figure above, different from normal BI cases, our users only needs to describe the data analysis needs by typing. Based on our company\'s NLP capabilities, AI Chatbots BI will convert natural language into SQL, which similar to NL2SQL technology. It should be noted that the natural language analysis used here is customized. Comparing with open source NL2SQL, the hit rate is high and the analysis is more precise. After the natural language is converted into SQL, the SQL will give Apache Doris query to get the analysis result. As a result, users can view detailed data in any cases at any time by typing. **Compared with pre-computed OLAP engines such as Apache Kylin and Apache Druid, Apache Doris performs better for the following reasons:**\\n\\n- The query is flexible and the model is not fixed, which supports customization.\\n\\n- It needs to support table association, aggregation calculation, and detailed query.\\n\\n- Response time needs to be fast.\\n\\nTherefore, we have successfully implemented AI Chatbots analysis by using Apache Doris. At the same time, feedback on the application in our company is awesome.\\n\\n## Experience\\n\\nBased on the above two scenarios, we have accumulated some experience and insights and I will share them with you now.\\n\\n### Datawarehouse Table Design:\\n\\n1. Tables which contain about tens of millions of data(for reference, related to the size of the cluster) is better to use the Duplicate table type. The Duplicate table type supports aggregation and detailed query at the same time, without additional detailed tables required.\\n\\n2. When the amount of data is relatively large, we suggest to use the Aggregate aggregation table type, build a rollup index on the aggregation table type, use materialized views to optimize queries, and optimize aggregation fields.\\n\\n3. When the amount of data is large with many associated tables, ETL can be used to write wide tables, imports to Doris, combined with Aggregate to optimize the aggregation table type. Or we suggest you use the official Doris JOIN optimization refer to: https://doris .apache.org/en-US/docs/dev/advanced/join-optimization/doris-join-optimization\\n\\n### Storage:\\n\\nWe use SSD and HDD to separate hot and warm data storage. Data within the past year is stored in SSD, and data more than one year is stored in HDD. Apache Doris supports setting cooling time for partitions. The current solution is to set automatic synchronization to migrate historical data from SSD to HDD to ensure that the data within one year is placed in on the SSD.\\n\\n### Upgrade\\n\\nMake sure to back up the metadata before upgrading. You can also use the method of starting a new cluster to back up the data files to a remote storage system such as S3 or HDFS through Broker, and then import the previous cluster data into the new cluster through backup and recovery.\\n\\n### Performance Comparison\\n\\nAspire started using Apache Doris from version 0.12. This year we completed the upgrade from version 0.15 to the latest version 1.1, and conducted performance tests based on real business data.\\n\\n![doris_1_1_performance_test_git](/images/doris_1_1_performance_test_git.png)\\n\\nAs can be seen from the test report, among the 13 SQLs test in total, the performance difference of the first 3 SQLs after the upgrade is not obvious, because these 3 scenarios are mainly simple aggregation functions, which do not require high performance of Apache Doris. Version 0.15 can meet demand. In the scenario after Q4, SQL is more complex while Group By needs multiple fields, aggregation functions and complex functions. Therefore, the performance improvement after upgrading is obvious to see: the average query performance is 2- 3 times. We highly recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of Apache Doris.\\n\\n## Summary and Benefits\\n\\n1. Apache Doris supports the construction of offline plus real-time unified data warehouses. One ETL script can support both real-time and offline data warehouses, which greatly greatly improved efficiency, reduces storage costs, and avoids problems such as inconsistencies between offline and real-time indicators.\\n\\n2. Apache Doris 1.1.x version fully supports vectorization, which improves the query performance by 2-3 times compared with the previous version. After testing, the query performance of Apache Doris version 1.1.x in the wide table is equal to that of ClickHouse.\\n\\n3. Apache Doris is powerful and does not depend on other components. Compared with Apache Kylin, Apache Druid, ClickHouse, Apache Doris does not need a second component to fill the technical gap. Apache Doris supports aggregation, detailed queries, and associated queries. Currently, more than 90% of AISPEACH\' analysis have migrated to Apache Doris. Thanks to this advantage, developers operate and maintain fewer components, which greatly reduces the cost of operation and maintenance.\\n\\n4. It is extremely easy to use, supporting MySQL protocol and standard SQL, which greatly reduces user learning costs.\\n\\n_Special thanks to SelectDB, the company building Apache Doris helps us work with the community and get sufficient technical support._"},{"id":"/ssb","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/ssb","source":"@site/blog/ssb.md","title":"Apache Doris 1.2 Star-Schema-Benchmark Performance Test Report","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2022-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 22, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Tech Sharing","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-sharing"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Apache Doris"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Apache Doris 1.2 Star-Schema-Benchmark Performance Test Report","summary":"On the SSB flat wide table, the overall performance of Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01 has been improved by nearly 4 times compared with Apache Doris 1.1.3, and nearly 10 times compared with Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04.

SSB provides a simplified star schema data based on [TPC-H](http://www.tpc.org/tpch/), which is mainly used to test the performance of multi-table JOIN query under star schema.  In addition, the industry usually flattens SSB into a wide table model (Referred as: SSB flat) to test the performance of the query engine, refer to [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/docs/zh/getting-started).\\n\\nThis document mainly introduces the performance of Doris on the SSB 100G test set.\\n\\n> Note 1: The standard test set including SSB usually has a large gap with the actual business scenario, and some tests will perform parameter tuning for the test set. Therefore, the test results of the standard test set can only reflect the performance of the database in a specific scenario. It is recommended that users use actual business data for further testing.\\n>\\n> Note 2: The operations involved in this document are all performed in the Ubuntu Server 20.04 environment, and CentOS 7 as well.\\n\\nWith 13 queries on the SSB standard test data set, we conducted a comparison test based on Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01, Apache Doris 1.1.3 and Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04 versions.\\n\\nOn the SSB flat wide table, the overall performance of Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01 has been improved by nearly 4 times compared with Apache Doris 1.1.3, and nearly 10 times compared with Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04.\\n\\nOn the SQL test with standard SSB, the overall performance of Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01 has been improved by nearly 2 times compared with Apache Doris 1.1.3, and nearly 31 times compared with Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04.\\n\\n## 1.

The test results are as follows:\\n\\n| Query | Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01 (ms) | Apache Doris 1.1.3 (ms) | Doris 0.15.0 RC04 (ms) |\\n| ----- | ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |\\n| Q1.1  | 40      | 18                    | 350                           |\\n| Q1.2  | 30      | 100                    | 80                             |\\n| Q1.3  | 20      | 70                     | 80                            |\\n| Q2.1  | 350     | 940                  | 20,680                     |\\n| Q2.2  | 320     | 750                  | 18,250                    |\\n| Q2.3  | 300     | 720                  | 14,760                   |\\n| Q3.1  | 650     | 2,150                 | 22,190                   |\\n| Q3.2  | 260     | 510                 | 8,360                          |\\n| Q3.3  | 220     | 450                  | 6,200                        |\\n| Q3.4  | 60      | 70                   | 160                            |\\n| Q4.1  | 840     | 1,480                   | 24,320                      |\\n| Q4.2  | 460     | 560                 | 6,310                          |\\n| Q4.3  | 610     | 660                  | 10,170                    |\\n| Total  | 4,160    | 8,478                | 131,910 |\\n\\n![ssb_12_11_015](/images/ssb.png)\\n\\n**Interpretation of Results**\\n\\n- The data set corresponding to the test results is scale 100, about 600 million.\\n- The test environment is configured as the user\'s common configuration, with 4 cloud servers, 16-core 64G SSD, and 1 FE 3 BEs deployment.\\n- We select the user\'s common configuration test to reduce the cost of user selection and evaluation, but the entire test process will not consume so many hardware resources.\\n\\n## 6. Environment Preparation\\n\\nPlease first refer to the [official documentation](. /install/install-deploy.md) to install and deploy Apache Doris first to obtain a Doris cluster which is working well(including at least 1 FE 1 BE, 1 FE 3 BEs is recommended).\\n\\nThe scripts mentioned in the following documents are stored in the Apache Doris codebase: [ssb-tools](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools)\\n\\n## 7. Data Preparation\\n\\n### 7.1 Download and Install the SSB Data Generation Tool.\\n\\nExecute the following script to download and compile the [ssb-dbgen](https://github.com/electrum/ssb-dbgen.git) tool.\\n\\n```shell\\nsh build-ssb-dbgen.sh\\n````\\n\\nAfter successful installation, the `dbgen` binary will be generated under the `ssb-dbgen/` directory.\\n\\n### 7.2 Generate SSB Test Set\\n\\nExecute the following script to generate the SSB dataset:\\n\\n```shell\\nsh gen-ssb-data.sh -s 100 -c 100\\n````\\n\\n> Note 1: Check the script help via `sh gen-ssb-data.sh -h`.\\n>\\n> Note 2: The data will be generated under the `ssb-data/` directory with the suffix `.tbl`. The total file size is about 60GB and may need a few minutes to an hour to generate.\\n>\\n> Note 3: `-s 100` indicates that the test set size factor is 100, `-c 100` indicates that 100 concurrent threads generate the data of the lineorder table. The `-c` parameter also determines the number of files in the final lineorder table. The larger the parameter, the larger the number of files and the smaller each file.\\n\\nWith the `-s 100` parameter, the resulting dataset size is:\\n\\n| Table     | Rows             | Size | File Number |\\n| --------- | ---------------- | ---- | ----------- |\\n| lineorder | 600,037,902 | 60GB | 100         |\\n| customer  | 3,000,000 | 277M | 1           |\\n| part      | 1,400,000 | 116M | 1           |\\n| supplier  | 200,000   | 17M  | 1           |\\n| date      | 2,556             | 228K | 1           |\\n\\n### 7.3 Create Table\\n\\n#### 7.3.1 Prepare the `doris-cluster.conf` File.\\n\\nBefore import the script, you need to write the FE\u2019s ip port and other information in the `doris-cluster.conf` file.\\n\\nThe file location is at the same level as `load-ssb-dimension-data.sh`.\\n\\nThe content of the file includes FE\'s ip, HTTP port, user name, password and the DB name of the data to be imported:\\n\\n```shell\\nexport FE_HOST=\\"xxx\\"\\nexport FE_HTTP_PORT=\\"8030\\"\\nexport FE_QUERY_PORT=\\"9030\\"\\nexport USER=\\"root\\"\\nexport PASSWORD=\'xxx\'\\nexport DB=\\"ssb\\"\\n```\\n\\n#### 7.3.2 Execute the Following Script to Generate and Create the SSB Table:\\n\\n```shell\\nsh create-ssb-tables.sh\\n````\\n\\nOr copy the table creation statements in [create-ssb-tables.sql](https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools/ddl/create-ssb-tables.sql) and [ create-ssb-flat-table.sql](https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools/ddl/create-ssb-flat-table.sql) and then execute them in the MySQL client.\\n\\nThe following is the `lineorder_flat` table build statement. Create the `lineorder_flat` table in the above `create-ssb-flat-table.sh` script, and perform the default number of buckets (48 buckets). You can delete this table and adjust the number of buckets according to your cluster scale node configuration, so as to obtain a better test result.\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE `lineorder_flat` (\\n  `LO_ORDERDATE` date NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_ORDERKEY` int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_LINENUMBER` tinyint(4) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_CUSTKEY` int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_PARTKEY` int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_SUPPKEY` int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_ORDERPRIORITY` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_SHIPPRIORITY` tinyint(4) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_QUANTITY` tinyint(4) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_EXTENDEDPRICE` int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_ORDTOTALPRICE` int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_DISCOUNT` tinyint(4) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_REVENUE` int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_SUPPLYCOST` int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_TAX` tinyint(4) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_COMMITDATE` date NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `LO_SHIPMODE` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `C_NAME` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `C_ADDRESS` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `C_CITY` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `C_NATION` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `C_REGION` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `C_PHONE` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `C_MKTSEGMENT` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `S_NAME` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `S_ADDRESS` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `S_CITY` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `S_NATION` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `S_REGION` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `S_PHONE` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `P_NAME` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `P_MFGR` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `P_CATEGORY` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `P_BRAND` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `P_COLOR` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `P_TYPE` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `P_SIZE` tinyint(4) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\",\\n  `P_CONTAINER` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \\"\\"\\n) ENGINE=OLAP\\nDUPLICATE KEY(`LO_ORDERDATE`, `LO_ORDERKEY`)\\nCOMMENT \\"OLAP\\"\\nPARTITION BY RANGE(`LO_ORDERDATE`)\\n(PARTITION p1 VALUES [(\'0000-01-01\'), (\'1993-01-01\')),\\nPARTITION p2 VALUES [(\'1993-01-01\'), (\'1994-01-01\')),\\nPARTITION p3 VALUES [(\'1994-01-01\'), (\'1995-01-01\')),\\nPARTITION p4 VALUES [(\'1995-01-01\'), (\'1996-01-01\')),\\nPARTITION p5 VALUES [(\'1996-01-01\'), (\'1997-01-01\')),\\nPARTITION p6 VALUES [(\'1997-01-01\'), (\'1998-01-01\')),\\nPARTITION p7 VALUES [(\'1998-01-01\'), (\'1999-01-01\')))\\nDISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`LO_ORDERKEY`) BUCKETS 48\\nPROPERTIES (\\n\\"replication_num\\" = \\"1\\",\\n\\"colocate_with\\" = \\"groupxx1\\",\\n\\"in_memory\\" = \\"false\\",\\n\\"storage_format\\" = \\"DEFAULT\\"\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### 7.4 Import data\\n\\nWe use the following command to complete all data import of SSB test set and SSB FLAT wide table data synthesis and then import into the table.\\n\\n```shell\\n sh bin/load-ssb-data.sh -c 10\\n```\\n\\n`-c 5` means start 10 concurrent threads to import (5 by default). In the case of a single BE node, the lineorder data generated by `sh gen-ssb-data.sh -s 100 -c 100` will also generate the data of the ssb-flat table in the end. If more threads are enabled, the import speed can be accelerated. But it will cost extra memory.\\n\\n> Notes.\\n>\\n> 1. To get faster import speed, you can add `flush_thread_num_per_store=5` in be.conf and then restart BE. This configuration indicates the number of disk writing threads for each data directory, 2 by default. Larger data can improve write data throughput, but may increase IO Util. (Reference value: 1 mechanical disk, with 2 by default, the IO Util during the import process is about 12%. When it is set to 5, the IO Util is about 26%. If it is an SSD disk, it is almost 0%) .\\n>\\n> 2. The flat table data is imported by \'INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... \'.\\n\\n### 7.5 Checking Imported data\\n\\n\\n```sql\\nselect count(*) from part;\\nselect count(*) from customer;\\nselect count(*) from supplier;\\nselect count(*) from date;\\nselect count(*) from lineorder;\\nselect count(*) from lineorder_flat;\\n```\\n\\nThe amount of data should be consistent with the number of rows of generated data.\\n\\n| Table          | Rows             | Origin Size | Compacted Size(1 Replica) |\\n| -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |\\n| lineorder_flat | 600,037,902 |             | 59.709 GB                 |\\n| lineorder      | 600,037,902 | 60 GB       | 14.514 GB                 |\\n| customer       | 3,000,000 | 277 MB      | 138.247 MB                |\\n| part           | 1,400,000 | 116 MB      | 12.759 MB                 |\\n| supplier       | 200,000   | 17 MB       | 9.143 MB                  |\\n| date           | 2,556             | 228 KB      | 34.276 KB                 |\\n\\n### 7.6 Query Test\\n\\n- SSB-Flat Query Statement: [ ssb-flat-queries](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools/ssb-flat-queries)\\n- Standard SSB Queries: [ ssb-queries](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools/ssb-queries)\\n\\n#### 7.6.1 SSB FLAT Test for SQL\\n\\n```sql\\n--Q1.1\\nSELECT SUM(LO_EXTENDEDPRICE * LO_DISCOUNT) AS revenue\\nFROM lineorder_flat\\nWHERE  LO_ORDERDATE >= 19930101  AND LO_ORDERDATE <= 19931231 AND LO_DISCOUNT BETWEEN 1 AND 3  AND LO_QUANTITY < 25;\\n--Q1.2\\nSELECT SUM(LO_EXTENDEDPRICE * LO_DISCOUNT) AS revenue\\nFROM lineorder_flat\\nWHERE LO_ORDERDATE >= 19940101 AND LO_ORDERDATE <= 19940131  AND LO_DISCOUNT BETWEEN 4 AND 6 AND LO_QUANTITY BETWEEN 26 AND 35;\\n\\n--Q1.3\\nSELECT SUM(LO_EXTENDEDPRICE * LO_DISCOUNT) AS revenue\\nFROM lineorder_flat\\nWHERE  weekofyear(LO_ORDERDATE) = 6 AND LO_ORDERDATE >= 19940101  AND LO_ORDERDATE <= 19941231 AND LO_DISCOUNT BETWEEN 5 AND 7  AND LO_QUANTITY BETWEEN 26 AND 35;\\n\\n--Q2.1\\nSELECT SUM(LO_REVENUE), (LO_ORDERDATE DIV 10000) AS YEAR, P_BRAND\\nFROM lineorder_flat WHERE P_CATEGORY = \'MFGR#12\' AND S_REGION = \'AMERICA\'\\nGROUP BY YEAR, P_BRAND\\nORDER BY YEAR, P_BRAND;\\n\\n--Q2.2\\nSELECT  SUM(LO_REVENUE), (LO_ORDERDATE DIV 10000) AS YEAR, P_BRAND\\nFROM lineorder_flat\\nWHERE P_BRAND >= \'MFGR#2221\' AND P_BRAND <= \'MFGR#2228\'  AND S_REGION = \'ASIA\'\\nGROUP BY YEAR, P_BRAND\\nORDER BY YEAR, P_BRAND;\\n\\n--Q2.3\\nSELECT SUM(LO_REVENUE), (LO_ORDERDATE DIV 10000) AS YEAR, P_BRAND\\nFROM lineorder_flat\\nWHERE P_BRAND = \'MFGR#2239\' AND S_REGION = \'EUROPE\'\\nGROUP BY YEAR, P_BRAND\\nORDER BY YEAR, P_BRAND;\\n\\n--Q3.1\\nSELECT C_NATION, S_NATION, (LO_ORDERDATE DIV 10000) AS YEAR, SUM(LO_REVENUE) AS revenue\\nFROM lineorder_flat\\nWHERE C_REGION = \'ASIA\' AND S_REGION = \'ASIA\' AND LO_ORDERDATE >= 19920101  AND LO_ORDERDATE <= 19971231\\nGROUP BY C_NATION, S_NATION, YEAR\\nORDER BY YEAR ASC, revenue DESC;\\n\\n--Q3.2\\nSELECT C_CITY, S_CITY, (LO_ORDERDATE DIV 10000) AS YEAR, SUM(LO_REVENUE) AS revenue\\nFROM lineorder_flat\\nWHERE C_NATION = \'UNITED STATES\' AND S_NATION = \'UNITED STATES\' AND LO_ORDERDATE >= 19920101 AND LO_ORDERDATE <= 19971231\\nGROUP BY C_CITY, S_CITY, YEAR\\nORDER BY YEAR ASC, revenue DESC;\\n\\n--Q3.3\\nSELECT C_CITY, S_CITY, (LO_ORDERDATE DIV 10000) AS YEAR, SUM(LO_REVENUE) AS revenue\\nFROM lineorder_flat\\nWHERE C_CITY IN (\'UNITED KI1\', \'UNITED KI5\') AND S_CITY IN (\'UNITED KI1\', \'UNITED KI5\') AND LO_ORDERDATE >= 19920101 AND LO_ORDERDATE <= 19971231\\nGROUP BY C_CITY, S_CITY, YEAR\\nORDER BY YEAR ASC, revenue DESC;\\n\\n--Q3.4\\nSELECT C_CITY, S_CITY, (LO_ORDERDATE DIV 10000) AS YEAR, SUM(LO_REVENUE) AS revenue\\nFROM lineorder_flat\\nWHERE C_CITY IN (\'UNITED KI1\', \'UNITED KI5\') AND S_CITY IN (\'UNITED KI1\', \'UNITED KI5\') AND LO_ORDERDATE >= 19971201  AND LO_ORDERDATE <= 19971231\\nGROUP BY C_CITY, S_CITY, YEAR\\nORDER BY YEAR ASC, revenue DESC;\\n\\n--Q4.1\\nSELECT (LO_ORDERDATE DIV 10000) AS YEAR, C_NATION, SUM(LO_REVENUE -

The data that is queried and populates the database has broad industry relevance. This benchmark demonstrates a decision support system that examines large amounts of data, executes highly complex queries, and answers key business questions. The performance index reported by TPC-H is called TPC-H composite query performance index per hour (QphH@Size), which reflects multiple aspects of the system\'s ability to process queries. These aspects include the database size chosen when executing the query, the query processing capability when the query is submitted by a single stream, and the query throughput when the query is submitted by many concurrent users.\\n\\nThis document mainly introduces the performance of Doris on the TPC-H 100G test set.\\n\\n> Note 1: The standard test set including TPC-H is usually far from the actual business scenario, and some tests will perform parameter tuning for the test set. Therefore, the test results of the standard test set can only reflect the performance of the database in a specific scenario. We suggest users use actual business data for further testing.\\n>\\n> Note 2: The operations involved in this document are all tested on CentOS 7.x.\\n\\nOn 22 queries on the TPC-H standard test data set, we conducted a comparison test based on Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01, Apache Doris 1.1.3 and Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04 versions. Compared with Apache Doris 1.1.3, the overall performance of Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01 has been improved by nearly 3 times, and by nearly 11 times compared with Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04.\\n\\n## 1.

The total file size is about 100GB and may need a few minutes to an hour to generate.\\n>\\n> Note 3: A standard test data set of 100G is generated by default.\\n\\n### 7.3 Create Table\\n\\n#### 7.3.1 Prepare the `doris-cluster.conf` File\\n\\nBefore import the script, you need to write the FE\u2019s ip port and other information in the `doris-cluster.conf` file.\\n\\nThe file location is at the same level as `load-tpch-data.sh`.\\n\\nThe content of the file includes FE\'s ip, HTTP port, user name, password and the DB name of the data to be imported:\\n\\n```shell\\n# Any of FE host\\nexport FE_HOST=\'127.0.0.1\'\\n# http_port in fe.conf\\nexport FE_HTTP_PORT=8030\\n# query_port in fe.conf\\nexport FE_QUERY_PORT=9030\\n# Doris username\\nexport USER=\'root\'\\n# Doris password\\nexport PASSWORD=\'\'\\n# The database where TPC-H tables located\\nexport DB=\'tpch1\'\\n```\\n\\n#### Execute the Following Script to Generate and Create TPC-H Table\\n\\n```shell\\nsh create-tpch-tables.sh\\n```\\nOr copy the table creation statement in [create-tpch-tables.sql](https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/blob/master/tools/tpch-tools/create-tpch-tables.sql) and excute it in Doris.\\n\\n\\n### 7.4 Import Data\\n\\nPlease perform data import with the following command:\\n\\n```shell\\nsh ./load-tpch-data.sh\\n```\\n\\n### 7.5 Check Imported Data\\n\\nExecute the following SQL statement to check that the imported data is consistent with the above data.\\n\\n```sql\\nselect count(*)  from  lineitem;\\nselect count(*)  from  orders;\\nselect count(*)  from  partsupp;\\nselect count(*)  from  part;\\nselect count(*)  from  customer;\\nselect count(*)  from  supplier;\\nselect count(*)  from  nation;\\nselect count(*)  from  region;\\nselect count(*)  from  revenue0;\\n```\\n\\n### 7.6 Query Test\\n\\n#### 7.6.1 Executing Query Scripts\\n\\nExecute the above test SQL or execute the following command\\n\\n```\\n./run-tpch-queries.sh\\n```\\n\\n>Notice:\\n>\\n>1. At present, the query optimizer and statistics functions of Doris are not so perfect, so we rewrite some queries in TPC-H to adapt to the execution framework of Doris, but it does not affect the correctness of the results\\n>\\n>2. Doris\' new query optimizer will be released in future versions\\n>3. Set `set mem_exec_limit=8G` before executing the query\\n\\n#### 7.6.2 Single SQL Execution\\n\\nThe following is the SQL statement used in the test, you can also get the latest SQL from the code base.\\n\\n```SQL\\n--Q1\\nselect /*+SET_VAR(exec_mem_limit=8589934592, parallel_fragment_exec_instance_num=8, enable_vectorized_engine=true, batch_size=4096, disable_join_reorder=false, enable_cost_based_join_reorder=false, enable_projection=false) */\\n    l_returnflag,\\n    l_linestatus,\\n    sum(l_quantity) as sum_qty,\\n    sum(l_extendedprice) as sum_base_price,\\n    sum(l_extendedprice * (1 -

It allows users to import data into Doris in batch through HTTP access and returns the results of data import. The user can not only directly judge whether the data import is successful through the return body of the HTTP request, but also query the results of historical tasks by executing query SQL on the client.\\n\\n#  **Introduction to Stream Load**\\n\\nThe Doris import (Load) function is to import the user\'s original data into the Doris table. And Doris realizes a unified streaming import framework at the bottom. On this basis, Doris provides a very rich import mode to adapt to different data sources and data import requirements. Stream Load is one of the most commonly used data import methods for Doris users. It is a synchronous import method that allows users to import data in CSV format or JSON format into Doris in batch through HTTP access and return the results of data import. User can directly judge whether the data import is successful through the return body of the HTTP request, and can query the results of historical tasks by executing query SQL on the client. In addition, Doris also provides the operation audit function for Stream Load, which can audit the historical Stream Load task information through the audit log. The implementation principle of Stream Load will be deeply analyzed from the aspects of execution process, transaction management, implementation of import plan, data writing and operation audit of Stream Load.\\n\\n# 1 Implementation Process\\n\\nThe user submits the HTTP request of Stream Load to the FE, and the FE will forward the data import request to a BE node through HTTP Redirect, which will be the Coordinator of this Stream Load task. In this process, the FE node receiving the request only provides forwarding service. The BE node as the Coordinator is actually responsible for the entire import job, such as sending transaction requests to the Master FE, obtaining import execution plans from the FE, receiving real-time data, distributing data to other Executor BE nodes, and returning results to the user after data import. The user can also submit the HTTP request of Stream Load directly to a specified BE node, and the node will act as the Coordinator of this Stream Load task. During the Stream Load process, the Executor BE node is responsible for writing data to the storage layer.\\n\\nIn the Coordinator BE, all HTTP requests, including Stream Load requests, are processed through a thread pool. A Stream Load task is uniquely identified by the imported Label. The principle block diagram of Stream Load is shown in Figure 1.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-Stream-Load/Figure_1_en.png)\\n           \\n\\nThe complete execution process of Stream Load is shown in Figure 2:\\n\\n(1)The user submits the HTTP request of Stream Load to the FE (the user can also directly submit the HTTP request of Stream Load to the Coordinator BE).\\n\\n(2)FE, after receiving the Stream Load request submitted by the user, will perform HTTP Header parsing (including the library, table, Label and other information imported by parsing data), and then perform user authentication. If the HTTP Header is successfully resolved and the user authentication passes, the FE will forward the HTTP request of Stream Load to a BE node, which will be the Coordinator of this Stream Load. Otherwise, the FE will directly return the failure information of Stream Load to the user.\\n\\n(3)After receiving the HTTP request from Stream Load, the Coordinator BE will first perform HTTP Header parsing and data verification, including the file format of the parsed data, the size of the data body, the HTTP timeout, and user authentication. If the Header data verification fails, the Stream Load failure information will be directly returned to the user.\\n\\n(4)After the HTTP Header data verification is passed, the Coordinator BE will send a Begin Transaction request to the FE through Thrift RPC.\\n\\n(5)After the FE receives the Begin Transaction request sent by the Coordinator BE, it will start a transaction and return the Transaction ID to the Coordinator BE.\\n\\n(6)After the Coordinator BE receives the Begin Transaction success information, it will send a request to get the import plan to the FE through Thrift RPC.\\n\\n(7)After receiving the request for obtaining the import plan sent by the Coordinator BE, the FE will generate the import plan for the Stream Load task and return it to the Coordinator BE.\\n\\n(8)After receiving the import plan, the Coordinator BE starts to execute the import plan, including receiving the real-time data from HTTP and distributing the real-time data to other Executor BE through BRPC.\\n\\n(9)After receiving the real-time data distributed by the Coordinator BE, the Executor BE is responsible for writing the data to the storage layer.\\n\\n(10)After the Executor BE completes data writing, the Coordinator BE sends a Commit Transaction request to the FE through Thrift RPC.\\n\\n(11)After receiving the Commit Transaction request sent by the Coordinator BE, the FE will commit transaction, send the Publish Version task to the Executor BE, and wait for the Executor BE to execute the Publish Version.\\n\\n(12)The Executor BE asynchronously executes the Publish Version to change the Rowset generated by data import into a visible data version.\\n\\n(13)After the Publish Version completes normally or the execution timeout, the FE returns the results of the Commit Transaction and the Publish Version to the Coordinator BE.\\n\\n(14)The Coordinator BE returns the final result of Stream Load to the user.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-Stream-Load/Figure_2_en.png)\\n# 2 Transaction Management\\n\\nDoris ensures the atomicity of data import through Transaction. One Stream Load task corresponds to one transaction. The FE is responsible for the transaction management of Stream Load. The FE receives the Thrift RPC transaction request sent by the Coordinator BE node through the FrontendService. Transaction request types include Begin Transaction, Commit Transaction and Rollback Transaction. The transaction states of Doris include PREPARE, COMMITTED, VISIBLE, and ABORTED. The status flow process of the Stream Load transaction is shown in Figure 3.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-Stream-Load/Figure_3_en.png)\\n\\nThe Coordinator BE node will send a Begin Transaction request to the FE before data import. The FE will check whether the label requested by the Begin Transaction already exists. If the label does not exist in the system, it will open a new transaction for the current label, assign a Transaction ID to the transaction, and set the transaction status to PREPARE, then returns the Transaction ID and the success information of the Begin Transaction to the Coordinator BE. Otherwise, this transaction may be a repeated data import. The FE returns the Begin Transaction failure message to the Coordinator BE, and the Stream Load task exits.\\n\\nAfter the data is written in all Executor BE nodes, the Coordinator BE node will send a Commit Transaction request to the FE. After receiving the Commit Transaction request, the FE will execute the Commit Transaction and Publish Version operations. First, the FE will judge whether the number of replicas of data successfully written by each Tablet exceeds half of the total number of replicas of the tablet. If the number of replicas of data successfully written by each Tablet exceeds half of the total number of replicas of the Tablet (most of them are successful), the Commit Transaction is successful and the transaction status is set to COMMITTED; Otherwise, the Commit Transaction failure information is returned to the Coordinator BE. The COMMITTED status indicates that the data has been written successfully, but the data is not visible. You need to continue to execute the Publish Version task. After that, the transaction cannot be rolled back.\\n\\nThe FE will have a separate thread to execute the Publish Version on the Transaction with successful Commit. When the Publish Version is executed, the FE will send the Publish Version request to all Executor BE nodes related to the Transaction through Thrift RPC. The Publish Version task is executed asynchronously on each Executor BE node, and the Rowset generated by data import is changed into a visible data version. When all the Publish Version tasks on the Executor BE are successfully executed, the FE will set the transaction status to VISIBLE, and return the Commit Transaction and Publish Version success information to the Coordinator BE. When some Publish Version tasks fail, the FE will repeatedly issue a Publish Version request to the Executor BE node until the previously failed Publish Version task succeeds. If the transaction status has not been set to VISIBLE after a certain timeout period, the FE will return to the Coordinator BE the information that the Commit Transaction was successful but the Publish Version timed out (note that at this time, the data is still written successfully, but it is still invisible, and the user needs to wait for the transaction status to finally become VISIBLE).\\n\\nWhen obtaining the import plan from the FE fails, executing data import fails, or Commit Transaction fails, the Coordinator BE node will send a Rollback Transaction request to the FE to execute transaction rollback. After receiving the transaction rollback request, the FE will set the transaction status to ABORTED, and send a Clear Transaction request to the Executor BE through Thrift RPC. The Clear Transaction task is asynchronously executed at the BE node, marking the Rowset generated by data import as unavailable. These Rowset will be deleted from the BE later. Transactions with COMMITTED status (transactions with Commit Transaction succeeded but Publish Version timed out) cannot be rolled back.\\n\\n# 3 Execution of the import plan\\nIn Doris BE, all execution plans are managed by FragmentMgr, and the execution of each import plan is managed by PlanFragmentExecutor. After the BE obtains the import execution plan from the FE, it will submit the import plan to the thread pool of FragmentMgr for execution. The import execution plan of Stream Load has only one Fragment, including one BrokerScanNode and one OlapTableSink. BrokerScanNode is responsible for reading streaming data in real time and converting the data lines in CSV format or JSON format to the Tuple format of Doris. OlapTableSink is responsible for sending real-time data to the corresponding Executor BE node. The Executor BE node corresponding to each data row is determined by which BE the Tablet where the data row is stored. The Partition and Tablet where the data row is stored can be determined according to the PartitionKey and DistributionKey of the data row. The BE node on which each Tablet and its replica are stored has been determined when the Table or Partition is created.\\n\\nAfter importing the execution plan and submitting it to the thread pool of FragmentMgr, the Stream Load thread will receive the real-time data transmitted through HTTP in chunks and write it to the StreamLoadPipe. The BrokerScanNode will read the real-time data in batches from the StreamLoadPipe. OlapTableSink will send the batch data read by the BrokerScanNode to the Executor BE through BRPC for data writing. After all real-time data is written to the StreamLoadPipe, the Stream Load thread will wait for the import plan to finish.\\n\\nThe PlanFragmentExecutor executes a specific import plan process, which consists of three stages: Prepare, Open, and Close. In the Prepare stage, the import execution plan from the FE is mainly analyzed; In the Open stage, BrokerScanNode and OlapTableSink will be opened. BrokerScanNode is responsible for reading the real-time data of one Batch at a time, and OlapTableSink is responsible for calling BRPC to send the data of each Batch to other Executor BE nodes; In the Close stage, it is responsible for waiting for the data import to end and closing the BrokerScanNode and OlapTableSink. The import execution plan of Stream Load is shown in Figure 4.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-Stream-Load/Figure_4_en.png)\\n\\nOlapTableSink is responsible for the data distribution of the Stream Load task. Tables in Doris may have Rollup or Materialized view. Each Table and its Rollup and Materialized view are called an Index. In the process of data distribution, the IndexChannel will maintain a data distribution channel of the Index. The Tablet under the Index may have multiple replicas and are distributed on different BE nodes. The NodeChannel will maintain the data distribution channel of an Executor BE node under the IndexChannel. Therefore, the OlapTableSink contains multiple IndexChannel, and each NodeChannel contains multiple NodeChannel, as shown in Figure 5.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-Stream-Load/Figure_5_en.png)\\n\\nWhen OlapTableSink distributes data, it will read the data Batch obtained by BrokerScanNode row by row, and add the data row to the IndexChannel of each Index. The Partition and Tablet of the data row can be determined according to the PartitionKey and DistributionKey, and then the corresponding Tablet of the data row in other Index can be calculated according to the order of the Tablet in the Partition. Each Tablet may have multiple replicas distributed on different BE nodes. Therefore, in the IndexChannel, each data row will be added to the NodeChannel corresponding to each replica of its Tablet. Each NodeChannel has a send queue. When the new data rows in NodeChannel accumulate to a certain size, they will be added to the send queue as a data Batch. There will be a fixed thread in OlapTableSink to train each NodeChannel under each IndexChannel in turn, and call BRPC to send a data Batch in the sending queue to the corresponding Executor BE. The data distribution process of the Stream Load task is shown in Figure 6.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-Stream-Load/Figure_6_en.png)\\n\\n# 4 **Data Write**\\n\\nAfter receiving the data Batch sent by the Coordinator BE, the BRPC server of the Executor BE will submit the data writing task to the thread pool for asynchronous execution. In Doris BE, data is written to the storage layer in a hierarchical manner. Each Stream Load task corresponds to a LoadChannel on each Executor BE. The LoadChannel maintains the data writing channel of a Stream Load task and is responsible for the data writing of a Stream Load task on the current Executor BE node, LoadChannel can write the data of a Stream Load task in the current BE node to the storage layer in batches until the Stream Load task is completed. Each LoadChannel is uniquely identified by the load ID, and all LoadChannel on the BE node are managed by LoadChannelMgr. The Table corresponding to a Stream Load task may have multiple Index. Each Index corresponds to a TabletsChannel, which is uniquely identified by the Index ID. Therefore, there will be multiple TabletsChannel under each LoadChannel. The TabletsChannel maintains an Index data writing channel, which is responsible for managing the data writing of all the Tablet under the Index. The TabletsChannel will read the data Batch row by row and write it to the corresponding Tablet through the DeltaWriter. The DeltaWriter maintains a data writing channel of a Tablet, which is uniquely identified by the Tablet ID. it is responsible for receiving the data import of a single Tablet and writing the data into the MemTable corresponding to the tablet. When the MemTable is full, the data in the MemTable will be flushed to the disk and Segment files will be generated. MemTable adopts the data structure of SkipList to temporarily store the data in memory. SkipList will sort the data rows according to the Key of Schema. In addition, if the data model is Aggregate or Unique, MemTable will aggregate data rows with the same Key. The data write channel of the Stream Load task is shown in Figure 7.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-Stream-Load/Figure_7_en.png)\\n\\nThe Flush operation of MemTable is performed asynchronously by MemtableFlushExecutor. After the MemTable Flush task is submitted to the thread pool, a new MemTable will be generated to receive the subsequent data writing of the current Tablet. When the MemtableFlushExecutor performs data Flush, the RowsetWriter will read out all the data in the MemTable and write out multiple Segment files through the SegmentWriter. The size of each Segment file is no more than 256MB. For a Tablet, each Stream Load task will generate a newRowset. The generated Rowset can contain multiple Segment files. The data writing process of the Stream Load task is shown in Figure 8.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-Stream-Load/Figure_8_en.png)\\n\\nThe TxnManager on the Executor BE node is responsible for transaction management of Tablet level data import. When the Delta Writer is initialized, the PrepareTransaction will be executed to add the data write transaction of the corresponding Tablet in the current Stream Load task to the TxnManager for management. When the data write Tablet is completed and the DeltaWriter is closed, the Commit Transaction will be executed to add the new Rowset generated by the data import to the TxnManager for management. Note that the TxnManager here is only responsible for the transactions on a single BE, while the transaction management in the FE is responsible for the overall import of transactions.\\n\\nAfter the data import is completed, when the Executor BE executes the Publish Version task issued by the FE, it will execute the Publish Transaction to change the new Rowset generated by the data import into a visible version, and delete the data writing task of the corresponding Tablet in the current Stream Load task from the TxnManager. This means that the data writing transaction of the Tablet in the current Stream Load task ends.\\n\\n# 5 **Stream Load Operation Audit**\\n\\nDoris adds the operation audit function to Stream Load. After each Stream Load task is completed and the results are returned to the user, the Coordinator BE will persistently store the detailed information of this Stream Load task on the local RocksDB. The Master FE periodically pulls the information of the completed Stream Load task from each BE node of the cluster through Thrift RPC, pulls a batch of Stream Load operation records from one BE node at a time, and writes the pulled Stream Load task information into the audit log (fe.audit.log). Each Stream Load task information stored on the BE will be set with an expiration time (TTL), and the expired Stream Load task information will be deleted when RocksDB executes the Compaction. The user can audit the historical Stream Load task information through the FE audit log.\\n\\nWhen the FE writes the pulled Stream Load task information into the Audit log, it will keep a copy in the memory. In order to prevent memory expansion, a fixed number of Stream Load task information will be kept in the memory. As the subsequent data pulling continues, the early Stream Load task information will be gradually eliminated from the FE memory. The user can query the latest Stream Load task information by executing the SHOW STREAM LOAD command at the client.\\n\\n# **Summary**\\n\\nIn this paper, the implementation principle of Stream Load is deeply analyzed from the aspects of execution process, transaction management, implementation of import plan, data writing and operation audit of Stream Load. Stream Load is one of the most commonly used data import methods for Doris users. It is a synchronous import method that allows users to import data into Doris in batch through HTTP access and return the results of data import. The user can not only directly judge whether the data import is successful through the return body of the HTTP request, but also query the results of historical tasks by executing query SQL on the client. Otherwise, Doris also provides the result audit function for Stream Load, which can audit the historical Stream Load task information through the audit log."},{"id":"/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing","source":"@site/blog/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing.md","title":"Doris analysis: Doris SQL principle analysis","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2022-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 25, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Tech Sharing","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-sharing"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Apache Doris"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Doris analysis: Doris SQL principle analysis","summary":"This article mainly introduces the principle of Doris SQL parsing.Since there are many types of SQL, this article focuses on the analysis of query SQL.

Doris\'s SQL analysis will be explained deeply in the algorithm principle and code implementation.\\n\\n# 1. Introduction to Doris\\nDoris is an interactive SQL database based on MPP architecture, mainly used to solve near real-time reports and multi-dimensional analysis. The Doris architecture is straightforward, with only two types of processes.\\n\\n- Frontend\uff08FE\uff09: It is mainly responsible for user request access, query parsing and planning, storage and management of metadata, and node management-related work.\\n\\n- Backend\uff08BE\uff09: It is mainly responsible for data storage and query plan execution.\\n\\nIn Doris\' storage engine, data will be horizontally divided into several data shards (Tablet, also called data bucket). Each tablet contains several rows of data. Multiple Tablets belong to different partitions logically. A Tablet only belongs to one Partition. And a Partition contains several Tablets. Tablet is the smallest physical storage unit for operations such as data movement, copying, etc.\\n\\n# 2. SQL parsing In Apache Doris\\nSQL parsing in this article refers to **the process of generating a complete physical execution plan after a series of parsing of an SQL statement**.\\n\\nThis process includes the following four steps: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, generating a logical plan, and generating a physical plan.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_1_en.png)\\n\\n## 2.1 Lexical analysis\\nThe lexical analysis will identify the SQL in the form of a string into tokens, in preparation for the grammatical analysis.\\n```undefined\\nselect ......  from ...... where ....... group by ..... order by ......\\n\\nSQL Tokens could be divided into the following categories:\\n\uffee Keywords (select, from, where)\\n\uffee operator (+, -, >=)\\n\uffee Open/close flag ((, CASE)\\n\uffee placeholder (?)\\n\uffee Comments\\n\uffee space\\n......\\n```\\n## 2.2 Syntax analysis\\nThe syntax analysis will convert the token generated by the lexical analysis into an abstract syntax tree based on the syntax rules, as shown in Figure 2.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_2_en.png)\\n\\n## 2.3 Logical plan\\nThe logical plan converts the abstract syntax tree into an algebraic relation, which is an operator tree, and each node represents a calculation method for data. The entire tree represents the calculation method and flows direction of data, as shown in Figure 3.\\n\\n ![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_3_en.png)\\n\\n## 2.4 Physical plan\\nThe physical plan is the plan that determines which computing operations are performed on which machines. It will be generated based on the logical plan, the distribution of machines, and the distribution of data.\\n\\nThe SQL parsing of the Doris system also adopts these steps, but it is refined and optimized according to the characteristics of the Doris system structure and the storage method of data to maximize the computing power of the machine.\\n\\n# 3. Design goals\\nThe design goals of the Doris SQL parsing architecture are:\\n\\n1. Maximize Computational Parallelism\\n\\n2. Minimize network transfer of data\\n\\n3. Minimize the amount of data that needs to be scanned\\n\\n# 4. Architecture\\nDoris SQL parsing includes five steps: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, generation of a stand-alone logical plan, generation of a distributed logical plan, and generation of a physical execution plan.\\n\\nIn terms of code implementation, it corresponds to the following five steps: Parse, Analyze, SinglePlan, DistributedPlan, and Schedule, which as shown in Figure 4.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_4_en.png)\\n\\nThe Parse phase will not be discussed in this article. Analyze will do some pre-processing of the AST. A stand-alone query plan will be optimized by SinglePlan based on the AST. DistributedPlan will split the stand-alone query plan into distributed query plans. Schedule phase will determine which machines the query plan will be sent to for execution.\\n\\n**Since there are many types of SQL, this article focuses on the analysis of query SQL.**\\n\\nFigure 5 shows a simple query SQL parsing implementation in Doris.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_5_en.png)\\n\\n# 5. Parse Phase\\nIn the Parse stage, JFlex technology is used for lexical analysis, java cup parser technology is used for syntax analysis, and an AST\uff08Abstract Syntax Tree\uff09will finally generate. These are existing and mature technologies and will not be introduced in detail here.\\n\\nAST has a tree-like structure, which represents a piece of SQL. Therefore, different types of queries -- select, insert, show, set, alter table, create table, etc. will generate additional data structures after Parse (SelectStmt, InsertStmt, ShowStmt, SetStmt, AlterStmt, AlterTableStmt, CreateTableStmt, etc.). However, they all inherit from Statements and will perform some specific processing according to their own grammar rules. For example: for select type SQL, the SelectStmt structure will be generated after Parse.\\n\\nSelectStmt structure contains SelectList, FromClause, WhereClause, GroupByClause, SortInfo and other structures. These structures contain more basic data structures. For Example, WhereClause contains BetweenPredicate, BinaryPredicate, CompoundPredicate, InPredicate, and so on.\\n\\nAll structures in AST are composed of basic structure expressions--Expr by using various combinations, as shown in Figure 6.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_6_en.png)\\n# 6. Analyze Phase\\nAnalyze will perform pre-processing and semantic analysis on the abstract syntax tree AST generated in the Parse phase, preparing for the generation of stand-alone logic plans.\\n\\nThe abstract class StatementBase represents the abstract syntax tree. This abstract class contains a most crucial member function--analyze(), which is used to perform what\'s needed to do in Analyze phase.\\n\\nDifferent types of queries (select, insert, show, set, alter table, create table, etc.) will generate different data structures through the Parse stage(SelectStmt, InsertStmt, ShowStmt, SetStmt, AlterStmt, AlterTableStmt, CreateTableStmt, etc.), these data structures inherit From StatementBase, and perform a specific Analysis on a specific type sof SQL by implementing the analyze() function.\\n\\nFor example, a query of select type will be converted into analyze() of the sub-statements SelectList, FromClause, GroupByClause, HavingClause, WhereClause, SortInfo, etc. of select SQL. Then these sub-statements further analyze() their sub-structures, and various scenarios of various types of SQL are analyzed by layer-by-layer iteration. For example, WhereClause will further explore the BetweenPredicate, BinaryPredicate, CompoundPredicate, InPredicate, etc., which it contains.\\n\\n**For query type SQL, Analyze will performs several important steps:**\\n\\n- **Metadata identification and parsing**\uff1a Identify and parse metadata such as Cluster, Database, Table, Column, etc. involved in SQL, and determine which columns, tables, databases, and clusters need to be calculated.\\n\\n- **SQL correctness check**\uff1asuch as the window function cannot DISTINCT, whether the projection column is ambiguous, the where statement cannot contain grouping operations, etc.\\n\\n- **Rewrite SQL simply**\uff1afor example, expand select * to select all columns, convert count distinct to bitmap or hll function, etc.\\n\\n- **Function correctness check**\uff1aCheck whether the functions contained in SQL are consistent with the system-defined procedures, including parameter types, number of parameters, etc.\\n\\n- **Aliasing for Table and Column.**\\n\\n- **Type checking and conversion**\uff1a For example, when the types on both sides of a binary expression are inconsistent, one of the types needs to be converted (with BIGINT and DECIMAL, the BIGINT type needs to be cast to DECIMAL).\\n\\nAfter analyzing the AST, a rewrite operation will be performed again to simplify or convert it into a unified processing method. A present rewrite algorithm is a rule-based approach. It will rewrite the AST with each rule from bottom to top, based on the tree structure of the AST. If the AST changes after rewriting, analysis and rewrite will start again until there is no change in the AST.\\n\\nFor example: simplification of constant expressions: 1 + 1 + 1 is rewritten as 3, 1 > 2 is rewritten as Flase, etc. Convert some statements into a unified processing method, such as rewriting where in, where exists as semi join, where not in, where not exists as anti join.\\n\\n# 7. Generate stand-alone logical Plan phase\\nAt this stage, algebraic relations will be generated according to the AST abstract syntax tree, also known as the operator number. Each node on the tree is an operator, representing an operation.\\n\\nAs shown in Figure 7, ScanNode represents scan and read operations on a table. HashJoinNode represents the join operation. A hash table of a small table will be constructed in memory, and the large table will be traversed to find the exact value of the join key. Project means the projection operation, which represents the column that needs to be output at the end. Figure 7 shows that only citycode column will output.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_7_en.png)\\n\\nWithout optimization, the generated relational algebra is very expensive to send to storage and execute.\\n\\nFor query:\\n```sql\\nselect a.siteid, a.pv from table1 a join table2 b on a.siteid = b.siteid where a.citycode=122216 and b.username=\\"test\\" order by a.pv limit 10\\n```\\nAs shown in Figure 8, for unoptimized relational algebra, all columns need to be read out for a series of calculations. In the end, siteid and pv column are selected and output. A large amount of useless column data wastes computing resources.\\n\\nWhen Doris generates algebraic relations, a lot of optimizations are made: the projection columns and query conditions will be put into the scan operation as much as possible.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_8_en.png)\\n\\n**Specifically, this phase mainly does the following tasks:**\\n\\n- **Slot materialization**\uff1aDetermine the column that needs to be scanned and calculated for the expression. Such as aggregate function expressions and Group By words of aggregate nodes need to be materialized.\\n\\n- **Projection pushdown**\uff1aBE only scans the columns that must be read when Scanning.\\n\\n- **Predicate pushdown**\uff1aPush down the filter conditions to the Scan node as much as possible under the premise of semantically correct.\\n\\n- **Partition, bucket cutting**\uff1aAccording to the information in the filter conditions, determine which partitions and buckets of tablets need to be scanned.\\n\\n- **Join Reorder**\uff1aFor Inner Join, Doris will adjust the order of the table according to the number of rows--put the large table in the front.\\n\\n- **Sort + Limit optimized to TopN**\uff1aFor the order by the limit statement, it will be converted into TopN operation nodes, which is convenient for unified processing.\\n\\n- **MaterializedView selection**: The best-materialized view will be selected according to the columns required by the query, the columns for filtering, sorting and Join, the number of rows, the number of columns, and other factors.\\n\\nFigure 9 shows an example of optimization. The optimization of Doris is carried out in generating relational algebra. Generating one will optimize one.\xb7 Projection pushdown: BE only scans the columns that must be read when Scanning.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_9_en.png)\\n\\n# 8 Generate Distributed Plan Phase\\n\\nAfter the single-machine PlanNode tree is generated, it needs to be split into a distributed PlanFragment tree (PlanFragment is used to represent an independent execution unit) according to the distributed environment. A table\'s data is distributed across multiple hosts could allow some computations to be parallelized.\\n\\nThe primary purpose of this step is to maximize parallelism and data localization. The primary strategy is to split the nodes that can be executed in parallel and create a separate PlanFragment. ExchangeNodes will replace the split nodes to receive data. Finally, a DataSinkNode will be added to the split node to transmit the calculated data to the ExchangeNode for further processing.\\n\\nThis step adopts a recursive method, traverses the entire PlanNode tree from bottom to top, and then creates a PlanFragment for each leaf node on the tree. If the parent node is encountered, splitting the child nodes that can be executed in parallel will be considered.\\n\\nFor query operations, the join operation is the most common.\\n\\n**Doris currently supports four join algorithms:** broadcast join, hash partition join, colocate join, and bucket shuffle join.\\n\\n**broadcast join**\uff1aSend the small table to each machine where the large table is located and perform a hash join operation. When the amount of data scanned from a table is small, the cost of broadcast join will be calculated, and the method with the smallest cost will be selected by calculating and comparing the cost of hash partitions.\\n\\n**hash partition join**\uff1aWhen the data scanned from the two tables are both large, hash partition join is generally used. It traverses all the data in the table, calculates the hash value of the key, then modulizes the number of clusters, and whichever machine is selected, the data will be sent to this machine for hash join operation.\\n\\n**colocate join**\uff1aIf the data distribution of the two tables is specified to be consistent when they are created, the colocate join algorithm will be used when the join key of the two tables is the same as the bucket key. Since the data distribution of the two tables is the same, the hash join operation is equivalent to a local process. It does not involve data transmission, which significantly improves query performance.\\n\\n**bucket shuffle join**\uff1aWhen the join key is a bucketing key, and only one partition is involved, the bucket shuffle join algorithm is preferred. Since bucketing itself represents a way of dividing data, it only needs to take the hash modulo of the number of buckets from the right table to the left table, so that only one copy of the data in the right table needs to be transmitted over the network, which greatly reduces the network of data transmission, as shown in Figure 10.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_10_en.png)\\n\\nFigure 11 shows the core process of creating a distributed logical plan with a single-machine logical plan with HashJoinNode.\\n\\n- For PlanNodes, PlanFragments are created bottom-up.\\n\\n- If it is a ScanNode, PlanFragment will be created directly, and the RootPlanNode of the PlanFragment is this ScanNode.\\n\\n- If it is a HashJoinNode, the broadcastCost will be calculated at first, which could provide a reference for selecting boracast join or hash partition join.\\n\\n- Join algorithm will be chosen according to different conditions.\\n\\n- If colocate joins are used, since joins are all local, no splitting is required. Set the left child node of HashJoinNode as the RootPlanNode of leftFragment, and the right child node as the RootPlanNode of rightFragment, share a PlanFragment with leftFragment, and delete rightFragment.\\n\\n- If bucket shuffle join is used, data from the right table needs to be sent to the left table. So first create an ExchangeNode, set the left child node of HashJoinNode as the RootPlanNode of leftFragment, the right child node as this ExchangeNode, share a PlanFragment with leftFragment, and specify the destination of rightFragment data to be sent to this ExchangeNode.\\n\\n- If broadcast join is used, the data from the right table needs to be sent to the left table. So first create an ExchangeNode, set the left child node of HashJoinNode as the RootPlanNode of leftFragment, the right child node as this ExchangeNode, share a PlanFragment with leftFragment, and specify the destination of rightFragment data to be sent to this ExchangeNode.\\n\\n- If hash partition join is used, the data in the left table and the right table must be split, and both left and right nodes need to be split out to create left ExchangeNode and right ExchangeNode respectively. HashJoinNode specifies the left and right nodes as left ExchangeNode and right ExchangeNode. Create a PlanFragment separately and specify RootPlanNode as this HashJoinNode. Finally, specify the data sending destination of leftFragment and rightFragment as left ExchangeNode and right ExchangeNode.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_11_en.png)\\n\\nFigure 12 is an example after the join operation of two tables is converted into a PlanFragment tree, there are 3 PlanFragments generated. The final output data passes through the ResultSinkNode node.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_12_en.png)\\n\\n# 9. Schedule phase\\n\\nThis step is to create a distributed physical plan based on the distributed logical plan. will solve the following questions:\\n\\n- Which BE executes which PlanFragment\\n\\n- Which replica to chooes for each Tablet to query\\n\\n- How to perform multi-instance concurrency\\n\\n**Figure 13 shows the core process for creating a distributed physical plan:**\\n\\n**a. Prepare phase**\uff1aCreate a FragmentExecParams structure for each PlanFragment to represent all the parameters required for PlanFragment execution; if a PlanFragment contains DataSinkNode, the destination PlanFragment for data transmission will be found, and specify the input of FragmentExecParams of the destination PlanFragment as FragmentExecParams of this PlanFragment.\\n\\n**b. computeScanRangeAssignment phase**\uff1aDifferent processing is performed for different types of joins.\\n\\n- computeScanRangeAssignmentByColocate: For colocate join processing, since the data distribution in the two table buckets of the join is the same, they are based on the bucket join operation, so here is to determine which host is selected for each bucket. When allocating buckets to hosts, try to ensure that the buckets allocated to each host are even.\\n\\n- computeScanRangeAssignmentByBucket: Processing for bucket shuffle join, which is only based on bucket operations, so here is to determine which host is selected for each bucket. When allocating buckets to hosts, it is also necessary to try to ensure that the buckets allocated to each host are even.\\n\\n- computeScanRangeAssignmentByScheduler: Process for other types of joins. Determines which replica of the tablet each scanNode reads. A scanNode will read multiple tablets, and each tablet has various copies. To distribute the scan operation on various machines as much as possible, improve concurrent performance, and reduce IO pressure, Doris uses the Round-Robin algorithm to distribute tablet scans to multiple machines as much as possible. For example, 100 tablets need to be scanned, each tablet has three copies, and ten machines could be used. When allocating, each machine is guaranteed to scan ten tablets.\\n\\n**c.computeFragmentExecParams phase**\uff1aThis stage determines which BE the PlanFragment is issued to for execution and how to handle instance concurrency. After the scan address of each tablet is determined, FragmentExecParams will generate multiple instances with the address as the dimension. If various addresses are contained in FragmentExecParams, various instances of FInstanceExecParam will be generated. If the concurrency is set, the execution instance of an address will be further split into multiple FInstanceExecParams. There will be some special processing for bucket shuffle join and colocate join, but the basic logic is the same. After FInstanceExecParam is created, a unique ID will be assigned to facilitate tracking information. If FragmentExecParams contains ExchangeNode, the number of senders will be counted to know how many senders\' data needs to be accepted. Finally, FragmentExecParams determines the destinations and fills in the destination address.\\n\\n**d. Create result receiver stage**\uff1aThe resulting receiver is where the final data needs to be output after the query is completed.\\n\\n**e. to thrift stage**\uff1aCreate RPC requests based on FInstanceExecParam of all PlanFragments, then send them to the BE side for execution. A complete SQL parsing process is completed.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_13_en.png)\\n\\nFigure 14 is a simple example. The PlanFrament in the figure contains a ScanNode. The ScanNode scans three tablets. Each tablet has two copies, and the cluster assumes that there are two hosts.\\n\\nThe computeScanRangeAssignment stage determines that replicas 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 need to be scanned, where replicas 1, 3, and 5 are located on host1, and replicas 8, 10, and 12 are located on host2.\\n\\nIf the global concurrency is set to 1, 2 instances of FInstanceExecParam are created and sent to host1 and host2 for execution. If the global concurrency is set to 3, 3 instances of FInstanceExecParam are created on this host1, and three instances of FInstanceExecParam are created on host2. Each instance scans one replica, equivalent to initiating 6 RPC requests.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/principle-of-Doris-SQL-parsing/Figure_14_en.png)\\n\\n# 10 Summary\\nThis article first briefly introduces Doris and then introduces the general process of SQL parsing: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, generating logical plans, and generating physical plans.

With the massive data, real-time data warehouse plays an irreplaceable role in effectively digging out valuable information, quickly obtaining data feedback, helping companies make faster decisions and better product iterations.\\n\\nIn this situation, Apache Doris stands out as a real-time MPP analytic database, which is high performance and easy to use, and supports various data import methods. Combined with Apache Flink, users can quickly import unstructured data from Kafka and CDC(Change Data Capture) from upstream database like MySQL. Apache Doris also provides sub-second analytic query capabilities, which can effectively satisfy the needs of several real-time scenarios: multi-dimensional analysis, dashboard and data serving etc.\\n# Challange\\n\\nUsually, there are many challenges to ensure high end-to-end concurrency and low latency for real-time data warehouses , such as:\\n\\n- How to ensure end-to-end data sync in second-level ?\\n\\n- How to quickly ensure data visibility ?\\n\\n- How to solve the problem of small files writing under high concurrency situation?\\n\\n- How to ensure end-to-end Exactly-Once?\\n\\nWithin the challenges above , we conducted an in-depth research on the business scenarios of users using Flink and Doris to build real-time data warehouses . After grasping the pain points of users, we made targeted optimizations in Doris version 1.1 and greatly improved the user experience  and improved the stability. The resource consumption of Doris has also been greatly optimized.\\n\\n# Optimization\\n\\n### Streamming Write\\n\\nThe initial practice of Flink Doris Connector is to cache the data into the memory batch after receiving data.The method of data writing is saving batches, and using parameters such as `batch.size` and `batch.interval` to control the timing of Stream Load writing at the same time.\\n\\nIt usually runs stably when the parameters are reasonable. Whatever the parameters are unreasonable, it would cause frequent Stream Load and compaction untimely, resulting in excessive version errors ( -235 ). On the other hand, when there is too much data, in order to reduce the writing frequency of Stream Load , the setting of `batch.size` too large may also cause OOM.\\n\\n**To solve this problem, we introduce streaming write:**\\n\\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/otliigutb8p9l1y6qyp6.png)\\n- After the Flink task starts, the Stream Load Http request will be asynchronously initiated.\\n\\n- When the data is received, it will be continuously transmitted to Doris through the Chunked transfer encoding of Http.\\n\\n- Http request will end at Checkpoint and complete the Stream Load writing . The next Stream Load request will be asynchronously initiated at the same time.\\n\\n- The data will continue to be received and the follow-up process is the same as above.\\n\\nThe pressure on the memory of the batch is avoided since the Chunked mechanism is used to transmit data. And the timing of writing is bound to the Checkpoint, which makes the timing of Stream Load controllable, and provides a basis for the following Exactly-Once semantics.\\n\\n### Exactly-Once\\n\\nExactly-Once means that data will not be reprocessed or lost, even machine or application failure. Flink supports the End-to-End\'s Exactly-Once scenario a long time ago, mainly through the two-phase commit protocol to realize the Exactly-Once semantics of the Sink operator.\\n\\nOn the basis of Flink\'s two-stage submission, with the help of Doris 1.0\'s Stream Load two-stage submission,Flink Doris Connector implements Exactly Once semantics. The specific principles are as follows:\\n\\n- When the Flink task is started, it will initiate a Stream Load PreCommit request. At this time, a transaction will be opened first, and data will be continuously sent to Doris through the Chunked mechanism of Http.\\n\\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ole5tqi91jibzdg9vqep.png)\\n\\n- Http request will be completed when the data writing ends at Checkpoint , and set the transaction status to preCommitted. The data has been written to BE and is invisible to the user at this time.\\n\\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jiieu1eff6smunkr85s5.png)\\n\\n- A Commit request will be initiated after the Checkpoint, and the transaction status will be set to Committed. The data will become visible to the user after request.\\n\\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eaona8eslljmkpaa9324.png)\\n\\n- After the Flink application ends unexpectedly and restarts from Checkpoint, if the last transaction was in the preCommitted state, a rollback request will be initiated and the transaction state will be set to Aborted.\\n\\nBased on the above , Flink Doris Connector can be used to realize real-time data storage without loss or weight.\\n\\n### Second- Level Data Synchronization\\n\\nEnd-to-end second-level data sync and real-time visibility of data in high concurrent write scenarios require Doris to have the following capabilities:\\n\\n- **Transaction Processing Capability**\\n\\nFlink real-time writing interacts with Doris in the form of Stream Load 2pc, which requires Doris to have the corresponding transaction processing capabilities to ensure the basic ACID characteristics, and support Flink\'s second-level data sync in high concurrency scenarios.\\n\\n- **Rapid Aggregation Capability of Data Versions**\\n\\nOne import in Doris will generate one data version. In a high concurrent write scenario, an inevitable impact is that there are too many data versions, and the amount of data imported in a single time will not be too large. The continuous high-concurrency small file writing scenario extremely tests the real-time ability and Doris\' data merging performance, which is not friendly to Doris, and in turn affects the performance of the query. Doris has greatly enhanced the data compaction capability in version 1.1, which can quickly complete the aggregation of new data, avoiding -235 errors and query efficiency problems which are caused by too many versions of sharded data.\\n\\nFirst of all, in Doris 1.1 version, QuickCompaction was introduced, which can actively triggered Compaction when the data version increased. At the same time, by improving the ability to scan fragment meta information, fragments that need to be compacted can be quickly discovered and trigger Compaction. Through active triggering and passive scanning, the real-time problem of data merging is completely solved.\\n\\nFor high-frequency small file Cumulative Compaction, the scheduling and isolation of Compaction tasks is implemented to prevent the heavyweight Base Compaction from affecting the merging of new data.\\n\\nFinally, the strategy of merging small files is optimized by adopting gradient merge method. Each time the files participating in the merging belong to the same data magnitude,which can prevent versions with large differences in size from merging, and gradually merges hierarchically, reducing the number of times a single file is involved in merging, which can greatly save the CPU consumption of the system.\\n\\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ez5qdcpgwjw60g9aacqd.png)\\n\\nDoris version 1.1 has made targeted optimizations for scenarios such as high concurrent import, second-level data sync, and real-time data visibility, which greatly increases the ease of use and stability of the Flink system and Doris system, saves the overall resources of the cluster.\\n\\n# Effect\\n\\n### General Flink High Concurrency Scenarios\\n\\nIn the general scenario of the survey, Flink is used to synchronize unstructured data in upstream Kafka. The data is written to Doris in real time by the Flink Doris Connector after ETL.\\n\\nThe customer scenario is extremely strict here. The upstream maintains a high frequency of 10w per second, and the data needs to be able to complete the upstream and downstream sync within 5s to achieve second-level data visibility. Flink is configured with 20 concurrency, and the Checkpoint interval is 5s. The performance of Doris version 1.1 is quite excellent.\\n\\nSpecifically reflected in the following aspects:\\n\\n- **Compaction Real-Time**\\n\\nData can be merged quickly, the number of tablet data versions is kept below 50, and the compaction score is stable. Compared with the previous -235 problem in high concurrent import scenario, the compaction efficiency is improved more than 10 times.\\n\\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d6enyv1zj68o7myjypnl.png)\\n\\n-  **CPU Resource Consumption**\\n\\nDoris version 1.1 has optimized the strategy for compaction of small files. In high-concurrency import scenarios, CPU resource consumption is reduced by 25%.\\n\\n- **QPS Query Delay is Stable**\\n\\nBy reducing the CPU usage and the number of data versions, the overall order of data has been improved, and the delay of SQL queries will be reduced.\\n\\n### Second-Level Data Synchronization Scenario (Extreme High Pressure)\\n\\nIn single bet and single tablet with 30 concurrent limit stream load pressure test on the client side, data in real-time <1s, the comparison before and after compaction score optimization as below:\\n\\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r01hn8hv6arzbdclknis.png)\\n# Recommendations\\n\\n### Real-Time Data Visualization Scenario\\n\\nFor strict latency requirements scenarios, such as second-level data synchronization, usually mean that a single import file is small, and it is recommended to reduce `cumulative_size_based_promotion_min_size_mbytes `. The default unit is 64 MB, and you can set it to 8 MB manually, which can greatly improve the compaction real-time performance. \\n\\n### High Concurrency Scenario\\n\\nFor high concurrent writing scenarios, you can reduce the frequency of Stream Load by increasing the checkpoint interval. For example, setting checkpoint to 5-10s can not only increase the throughput of Flink tasks, but also reduce the generation of small files and avoid causing compaction more pressure.\\n\\nIn addition, for scenarios that do not require high real-time data, such as minute-level data sync, the checkpoint interval can be increased, such as 5-10 minutes. And the Flink Doris connector can still ensure the integrity of data through the two-stage submission and checkpoint mechanism.\\n\\n# Future planning\\n\\n-  **Real-time Schema Change**\\n\\nWhen accessing data in real time through Flink CDC, the upstream business table will perform the schema change operation, it has to modify the schema manually in Doris and Flink tasks. In the end, the data of the new schema can be synchronized after restart the task . \\n\\nThis way requires human intervention, which will bring a great operation burden to users. In subsequent versions, real-time schema changes will support CDC scenarios, and the upstream schema changes will be synchronized to the downstream in real-time, which will comprehensively improve the efficiency of schema changes.\\n\\n-  **Doris Multi-table Writting**\\n\\nAt present, the Doris Sink operator only supports synchronizing a single table, so for the entire database, it still has to divide the flow manually at the Flink level and write to multiple Doris Sinks, which will increase the difficulty of developers. In subsequent versions, we will support a single Doris Sink to synchronize multiple tables, which greatly simplifies the user\'s operation.\\n\\n-  **Adaptive Compaction Parameter Tuning**\\n\\nAt present, the compaction strategy has many parameters, which can play a good role in most general scenarios, but these strategies still can\'t play an efficient role in some special scenarios. We will continue to optimize in subsequent versions, carry out adaptive compaction tuning for different scenarios, and keep improving data merging efficiency and real-time performance in various scenarios.\\n\\n-  **Single-Copy Compaction**\\n\\nThe current compaction strategy is that each BE is carried out separately. In subsequent versions, we will implement single-copy compaction, and realize compaction tasks by cloning snapshots, reduce system load while reducing about 2/3 compaction tasks of the cluster, leaving more system resources to the user side."},{"id":"/release-1.1.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-1.1.1","source":"@site/blog/release-1.1.1.md","title":"Apache Doris announced the official release of version 1.1.1","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2022-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 29, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Release Notes","permalink":"/blog/tags/release-notes"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Apache Doris"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Apache Doris announced the official release of version 1.1.1","summary":"Dear community, we are pleased to announce that we have officially released Apache Doris 1.1.1 on July 29, 2022!

Compared with other industry-hot OLAP database systems, the distributed architecture of Apache is very simple. Itsupports elastic scaling and is easy to operate and maintain, saving a lot of labor and time costs. At present, the domestic community is very popular , and there are also many companies which have large scale uses, such as Meituan and Xiaomi,etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nThis paper mainly discusses how to use Doris for business exploration and practice in the multi-dimensional analysis of real-time and offline data in the large real-time screen of JD customer service in the scenarios of manual consultation, customer event list, after-sales service list, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn recent years, with the explosive growth of data volume and the emergence of the demand for online analysis of massive data, traditional relational databases such as MySQL and Oracle have encountered bottlenecks under large data volume, while databases such as Hive and Kylin lack timeliness. So Apache Doris, Apache Druid, ClickHouse and other real-time analytic databases begun to appear, not only to cope with the second-level queries of massive data, but also to meet the real-time and quasi-real-time analysis needs. Offline and real-time computing engines are in full bloom. But for different scenarios and facing different problems, no single engine is a panacea. We hope that this article can give you some inspiration on the application and practice of offline and real-time analytics in JD\'s customer service business, and we hope you will communicate more and give us valuable suggestions.\\n\\n# **JD Customer Service Business Form**\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the entrance to the group\'s services, JD Customer Service provides efficient and reliable protection for users and merchants. JD customer service is responsible for solving users\' problems in a timely manner and providing them with detailed and easy-to-understand instructions and explanations; in order to better understand users\' feedback and the status of products, it is necessary to monitor a series of indicators such as the number of inquiries, pick-up rates, complaints, etc. in real time, and discover problems in a timely manner through ring comparison and year-on-year comparison, in order to better adapt to users\' shopping styles, improve service quality and efficiency, and thus enhance the brand of JD influence.\\n\\n\\n\\n# **Easy OLAP Design**\\n\\n\\n\\n### **01 EasyOLAP Doris Data Import Links**\\n\\n\\n\\nEasyOLAP Doris data sources are mainly real-time Kafka and offline HDFS files. The import of real-time data relies on Routine Load; offline data is mainly imported using Broker Load and Stream Load.\\n\\n\\n\\n![1280X1280](/images/jd03.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nEasyOLAP Doris Data Import Links\\n\\n\\n\\n### **02 EasyOLAP Doris Full Link Monitor**\\n\\n\\n\\nThe EasyOLAP Doris project currently uses the Prometheus + Grafana framework for monitoring. The node_exporter is responsible for collecting machine-level metrics, and Doris automatically spits out FE and BE service-level metrics in Prometheus format. In addition, OLAP Exporter service is deployed to collect Routine Load related metrics, aiming to discover real-time data stream import at the first time and ensure real-time data timeliness.\\n\\n\\n\\n![EasyOLAP Doris monitoring link](/images/jd04.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nEasyOLAP Doris monitoring link\\n\\n![640](/images/jd01.png)\\n\\n### **03 EasyOLAP Doris Primary-Secondary Dual Stream Design**\\n\\n\\n\\nEasyOLAP Doris adopts a dual-write approach for the primary and secondary clusters in order to guarantee the service stability of Level 0 services during the promotion time.\\n\\n\\n\\n![03 EasyOLAP Doris Primary-Secondary Dual Stream Design](/images/jd02.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nEasyOLAP Doris Primary-Secondary Dual Stream Design\\n\\n\\n\\n### **04 EasyOLAP Doris Dynamic Partition Management**\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter analyzing the requirements, the JD OLAP team did some customization of Doris, which involved dynamic partition management. Although the community version already had the function of dynamic partitioning, the function could not retain partitions of a specified time. For the characteristics of JD Group, we have retained historical data of specified time, such as data during 618 and 11.11, which will not be deleted due to dynamic partitioning. The dynamic partition management feature can control the amount of data stored in the cluster, and it is easy to use by the business side without the need to manage partition information manually or with additional code.\\n\\n\\n\\n# **Doris Caching Mechanism**\\n\\n\\n\\n### **01 Demand Scenarios**\\n\\n\\n\\nCommitted to continuously improving user experience, JD Customer Service\'s data analysis pursues the ultimate timeliness. Offline data analysis scenario is write less read more, data is written once and read frequently many times; real-time data analysis scenario, part of the data is not updated historical partition, part of the data is in the updated partition. In most analysis applications, there are the following scenarios:\\n\\n- High concurrency scenario: Doris better support high concurrency, but too high QPS will cause cluster jitter, and a single node can not carry too high QPS;.\\n\\n- Complex queries: JD customer service real-time operation platform monitoring needs to display multi-dimensional complex indicators according to business scenarios, rich indicators display corresponding to a variety of different queries, and data sources from multiple tables . Although the response time of individual queries at milliseconds level , the overall response time may be at the second level.\\n\\n- Repeated queries: if there is no anti-refresh mechanism, repeatedly refreshing the page will lead to the submission of a large number of repeated queries due to delays or hand errors.\\n\\nFor the above scenario, there are solutions at the application layer \u2014\u2014 the query results are put into Redis and the cache is refreshed periodically or manually by the user, but there are some problems\uff1a\\n\\n- Data inconsistency: can not respond immediately to data updates, and the user may receive results with old data.\\n\\n- Low hit rate: if the data is highly real-time and the cache is frequently invalidated, the hit rate of the cache is low and the load on the system cannot be relieved.\\n\\nAdditional cost: introduction of external components increases system complexity and adds additional cost.\\n\\n\\n\\n### **02 Introduction to Caching Mechanism**\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are three different types of Cache in EasyOLAP Doris, respectively Result Cache, SQL Cache and Partition Cache, depending on the applicable scenario. All three types of caches can be switched on and off by MySQL client commands.\\n\\nThese three caching mechanisms can coexist: which can be turned on at the same time. When querying, the query parser first determines whether the Result Cache is enabled or not, and if the Result Cache is enabled, it first finds out whether the cache exists for the query from the Result Cache, and if the cache fails or does not exist, it directly takes the cached value and returns it to the client. The cache is placed in the memory of each FE node for fast reading.\\n\\nSQL Cache stores and gets the cache according to the signature of SQL, the ID of the partition of the queried table, and the latest version number of the partition. These three together serve as cache conditions. If one of these three conditions is changed, such as SQL statement change or partition version number change after data update, the cache will not be hit. In the case of multiple table joins, the partition update of one of the tables will also result in failure to hit the cache. SQL Cache is more suitable for T+1 update scenarios.\\n\\nPartition Cache is a more fine-grained caching mechanism. Partition cache mainly splits a query into read-only partition and updatable partition in parallel based on partition, read-only partition is cached, updatable partition is not cached, and the corresponding result set is generated n, and then the results of each split subquery are merged. Therefore, if the query N days of data, data update the most recent D days, each day is only a different date range but similar queries, you can use Partition Cache, only need to query D partitions can be, the other parts are from the cache, can effectively reduce the cluster load, shorten the query response time.\\n\\nWhen a query enters Doris, the system will first process the query statement and take it as the key, before executing the query statement, the query analyzer can automatically select the most suitable caching mechanism to ensure that the caching mechanism is used to shorten the query response time in the best case. Then, it checks whether the query result exists in the Cache, and if it does, it gets the data in the cache and returns it to the client; if it does not, it queries normally and stores the query result as Value and the query statement Key in the cache. SQL Cache is more suitable for T+1 scenarios and works well when partition updates are infrequent and SQL statements are repetitive Partition Cache is the least granular cache. When a query statement queries data for a time period, the query statement is split into multiple subqueries. It can shorten the query time and save cluster resources when the data is written to only one partition or partial partition.\\n\\nTo better observe the effectiveness of caching, metrics have been added to Doris\' service metrics, which are monitored visually through Prometheus and Grafana monitoring systems. The metrics include the number of hits for different types of Cache, the hit rate for different types of Cache, the memory size of the Cache, and other metrics.\\n\\n\\n\\n### **03 Caching Mechanism Effect**\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the JD Customer Service Doris main cluster, some services reached 100% CPU usage during 11.11 period without caching on; with Result Cache on, CPU usage was between 30% and 40%. The caching mechanism ensures that the business can get the query results quickly and protects the cluster resources well under high concurrency scenarios.\\n\\n\\n\\n# **Doris\' optimization during the 11.11 sale, 2020**\\n\\n\\n\\n### **01 Import Task Optimization**\\n\\n\\n\\nThe import of real-time data has always been a challenge. Among them, ensuring real-time data and importing stability is the most important. In order to observe the real-time data import situation more intuitively, JD OLAP team developed OLAP Exporter independently to collect real-time data import-related metrics, such as import speed, import backlog and suspended tasks. The import speed and import backlog can be used to determine the status of a real-time import task, and if find a trend of backlog, the sampling tool developed independently can be used to sample and analyze the real-time task. Real-time tasks have three main thresholds to control the submission of tasks, which are the maximum processing interval per batch, the maximum number of processing entries per batch and the maximum amount of data processed per batch, and a task will be submitted as soon as one of these thresholds is reached. By increasing the logs, we found that the task queue in FE was relatively busy, so the parameters were mainly adjusted to make the maximum number of processing entries per batch and the maximum amount of data processed per batch larger, and then the maximum processing interval per batch was adjusted to ensure that the data latency was within twice the maximum processing interval per batch according to the business requirements. Through the sampling tool, the analysis task ensures not only the real-time data, but also the stability of the import. In addition, we also set up alarms to detect abnormalities such as backlog of real-time import tasks and suspension of import tasks in a timely manner.\\n\\n\\n\\n### **02 Monitoring Metrics Optimization**\\n\\n\\n\\nThe monitoring metrics are divided into two main sections, a machine level metrics section and a business level metrics section. In the whole monitoring panel, detailed metrics bring comprehensive data and at the same time make it more difficult to get important metrics. So, to get a better view of important metrics for all clusters, a separate panel is created - 11.11 Important Metrics Summary Panel. The board contains metrics such as BE CPU usage, real-time task consumption backlog rows, TP99, QPS, and so on. The number of metrics is small, but the situation of all clusters can be observed, which can eliminate the trouble of frequent switching in monitoring.\\n\\n\\n\\n### **03 Peripheral Tools Support**\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to the sampling tools and OLAP Exporter mentioned above, the JD OLAP team has also developed a series maintenance tools for Doris.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Import sampling tool: The import sampling tool not only collects the data imported in real time, but also supports adjusting the parameters of the real time import task, or generating creation statements (including the latest loci and other information) for task migration and other operations when the real time import task is paused.\\n\\n   \\n\\n2. Big query tool: Big queries not only cause jitter in cluster BE CPU usage, but also lead to longer response time for other queries. Before the Big Query tool, if you found jitter in cluster CPU, you needed to check the audit logs on all FEs and then do the statistics, which is not only time-consuming but also not intuitive. The Big Query tool is designed to solve the above problem. When the monitoring side finds that the cluster has jitter, you can use the Big Query tool and enter the cluster name and time point to get the total number of queries for different services at that time point, the number of queries with more than 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, the number of queries with huge scanning volume, etc. It is convenient for us to analyze the big queries from different dimensions. The details of the big queries will also be saved in the intermediate file, which can directly get the big queries of different businesses. The whole process only takes a few tens of seconds to a minute to locate the big query that is happening and get the corresponding query statements, which greatly saves time and operation and maintenance costs.\\n\\n   \\n\\n3. Downgrade and recovery tools: In order to ensure the stability of the Level 0 business during the 11.11 promotion, when the cluster pressure exceeds the safety level, it is necessary to downgrade other non-Level 0 businesses, and then restore them to the pre-downgrade settings with one click after the peak period. The degradation mainly involves reducing the maximum number of connections to the service, suspending non-level 0 real-time import tasks, and so on. This greatly increases the ease of operation and improves efficiency.\\n\\n   \\n\\n4. Cluster inspection tool: During 11.11 period, the health inspection of clusters is extremely important. Routine inspections include primary and secondary cluster consistency checks for dual-stream services. In order to ensure that the business can quickly switch to the other cluster when one cluster has problems, it is necessary to ensure that the library tables on both clusters are consistent and the data volume is not too different; check whether the number of copies of the library tables is 3 and whether there are unhealthy Tablet in the cluster; check the machine disk utilization, memory and other machine-level indicators, etc. Check the machine disk utilization, memory and other machine-level metrics, etc.\\n\\n   \\n\\n   # **Summary & Outlook**\\n\\n   \\n\\n   JD Customer Service was introduced to Doris in early 2020, and currently has one standalone cluster and one shared cluster, and is an experienced user of JD OLAP.\\n\\n   \\n\\n   In the business use, we also encountered problems such as task scheduling-related, import task configuration-related and query-related problems, which are driving the JD OLAP team to understand Doris more deeply. We plan to promote the use of materialized views to further improve the efficiency of queries; use Bitmap to support accurate de-duplication of UV and other metrics; use audit logs to make it easier to count large and slow queries; and solve the scheduling problem of real-time import tasks to make them more efficient and stable. In addition, we also plan to optimize table building, create high-quality Rollup or materialized views to improve the smoothness of the application, and accelerate more businesses to the OLAP platform to improve the impact of the application."},{"id":"/meituan","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/meituan","source":"@site/blog/meituan.md","title":"Best Practice of Apache Doris in Meituan","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2022-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 20, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Best Practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/best-practice"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Apache Doris"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Best Practice of Apache Doris in Meituan","summary":"Introduction: This paper mainly introduces a general method and practice of real-time data warehouse construction.

The real-time data warehouse aims at end-to-end low latency, SQL standardization, rapid response to changes, and data unification. In practice, the best practice we summarize is: a common real-time production platform + a common interactive real-time analysis engine cooperate with each other to meet real-time and quasi-real-time business scenarios. The two have a reasonable division of labor and complement each other to form an easy-to-develop, easy-to-maintain, and most efficient assembly line, taking into account development efficiency and production costs, and satisfying diverse business needs with a better input-output ratio.\\n\\n# real-time scene\\n\\nThere are many scenarios in which real-time data is delivered in Meituan, mainly including these following points:\\n\\n- Operational level: Such as real-time business changes, real-time marketing effects, daily business status and daily real-time business trend analysis, etc.\\n- Production level: such as whether the real-time system is reliable, whether the system is stable, real-time monitoring of the health of the system, etc.\\n- C-end users: For example, search recommendation sorting requires real-time understanding of users\' thoughts, behaviors and characteristics, and recommendation of more concerned content to users.\\n- Risk control: Food delivery and financial technology are used a lot. Real-time risk identification, anti-fraud, abnormal transactions, etc., are all scenarios where a large number of real-time data are applied\\n\\n# Real-time technology and architecture\\n\\n### 1.Real-time computing technology selection\\n\\nAt present, there are many open source real-time technologies, among which Storm, Spark Streaming and Flink are common. The specific selection depends on the business situation of different companies.\\n\\nMeituan Takeaway relies on the overall construction of meituan\'s basic data system. In terms of technology maturity, It used Storm a few years ago, which was irreplaceable in terms of performance stability, reliability and scalability. As Flink becomes more and more mature, it has surpassed Storm in terms of technical performance and framework design advantages. In terms of trends, just like Spark replacing MR, Storm will be gradually replaced by Flink. Of course, there will be a process of migrating from Storm to Flink. We currently have some old tasks still on Storm, and we are constantly promoting task migration.\\n\\nThe comparison between Storm and Flink can refer to the form above.\\n\\n### 2.Real-time Architecture\\n\\n#### \u2460 Lambda Architecture\\n\\nThe Lambda architecture is a relatively classic architecture. In the past, there were not many real-time scenarios, mainly offline. When a real-time scene is attached, the technical ecology is different due to the different timeliness of offline and real- time. The Lambda architecture is equivalent to attaching a real-time production link, which is integrated at the application level, and two-way production is independent of each other.This is also a logical approach to adopt in business applications.\\n\\nThere will be some problems in dual-channel production, such as double processing logic, double development and operation and maintenance, and resources will also become two resource links. Because of these problems,  Kappa architecture has been evolved.\\n\\n#### \u2461 Kappa Architecture\\n\\nThe Kappa architecture is relatively simple in terms of architecture design, unified in production, and a set of logic produces both offline and real time. However, there are relatively large limitations in practical application scenarios. There are few cases in the industry that directly use the Kappa architecture for production and implementation,  and the scene is relatively simple. These problems will also be encountered on our side, and we will also have some thoughts of our own, which will be discussed later.\\n\\n# Business Pain Points\\n\\nIn the take-away business, we also encountered some problems.\\n\\nIn the early stage of the business, in order to meet the business needs, the requirements are generally completed case by case after the requirements are obtained. The business has high real-time requirements. From the perspective of timeliness, there is no opportunity for middle-level precipitation. In the scenario, the business logic is generally directly embedded. This is a simple and effective method that can be imagined. This development mode is relatively common in the early stage of business development.\\n\\nAs shown in the figure above, after getting the data source, it will go through data cleaning, dimension expansion, business logic processing through Storm or Flink, and finally direct business output. Taking this link apart, the data source will repeatedly refer to the same data source, and the operations such as cleaning, filtering, and dimension expansion must be repeated. The only difference is that the code logic of the business is different. IIf there is less business, this model is acceptable, but when the subsequent business volume increases, there will be a situation where whoever develops will be responsible for operation and maintenance, the maintenance workload will increase, and the operations cannot be managed in a unified manner. Moreover, everyone is applying for resources, resulting in a rapid expansion of resource costs, and resources cannot be used intensively and effectively. Therefore, it is necessary to think about how to construct real-time data from the whole data source.\\n\\n# Data features and Application Scenario\\n\\nSo how to build a real-time data warehouse?\\n\\nFirst of all, we need to disassemble this task into what data, what scenarios, and what features these scenarios have in common. For takeaway business scenarios, there are two categories, log class and business category.\\n\\n- Log class: It is characterized by a large amount of data, semi-structured, and deeply nested.Log data has a great feature that once the log stream is formed, it will not change. It will collect all the logs of the platform by means of buried points, and then collect and distribute them uniformly. Just like a tree with really large roots.  The whole process of pushing to the front-end application is just like the process of a tree branching from the root to a branch (the decomposition process from 1 to n). If all businesses search for data from the root, although the path seems to be the shortest, because of the heavy burden,the data retrieval efficiency is low. Log data is generally used for production monitoring and user behavior analysis. The timeliness requirements are relatively high . Generally, the  time window will be 5 minutes or 10 minutes, or up to the current state. The main application is the real-time large screen and real-time features, such as behaviour can immediately perceive the need for waiting every time the user clicks.\\n\\n- Business category: The business class is mainly about business transaction data. Business systems are usually self-contained and distribute data down in the form of Binlog logs. All business systems are transactional, mainly using paradigm modeling methods, which have a structured characteristic and the main part can be seen clearly. However, due to the large number of data tables, multi-table associations are required to express the complete business. So it\'s an integrated machining process from n to 1 .\\n\\nSeveral difficulties faced by business real-time processing:\\n\\n- Diversity of business: Business processes are constantly changing from the beginning to the end, such as from ordering -> payment -> delivery. The business database is changed  on the original basis,and Binlog will generate a lot of changed logs. Business analysis is more focused on the end state, which leads to the problem of data retraction calculation, such as placing an order at 10 o\'clock and canceling it at 13 o\'clock, but hoping to subtract the canceled order at 10 o\'clock.\\n\\n- Business integration: Business analysis data usually cannot be expressed by a single subject, and often many tables are associated to obtain the desired information. When confluent alignment of data is performed in real-time streaming, it often requires large cache processing and is complicated.\\n\\n- The analysis is batch, and the processing process is streaming: for a single data, no analysis can be formed, so the analysis object must be batch, and the data processing is one by one.\\n\\nThe scenarios of log classes and business classes generally exist at the same time and are intertwined. Whether it is Lambda architecture or Kappa architecture, a single application will have some problems, so it is more meaningful to choose the architecture and practice according to the scenario.\\n\\n# Architecture Design of Real-time Data Warehouse\\n\\n### 1.Real-time Architecture: Exploration of Stream-Batch Combination\\n\\nBased on the above problems, we have our own thinking and ideas\uff0cit is to deal with different business scenarios through the combination of flow and batch.\\n\\nAs shown in the figure above, the data is collected from the log to the message queue, and then to the ETL process of the data stream. The construction of the basic data stream is unified. Afterwards, for log real-time features, real-time large-screen applications use real-time stream computing. Real-time OLAP batch processing is used for Binlog business analysis.\\n\\nWhat are the Pain Points of Stream Processing Analysis Business? For the paradigm business, both Storm and Flink require a large amount of external memory to achieve business alignment between data streams, which requires a lot of computing resources. Due to the limitation of external memory, the window limitation strategy must be carried out, and may eventually discard some data as a result. After calculation, it is generally stored in Redis as query support, and KV storage has many limitations in dealing with analytical query scenarios.\\n\\nHow to achieve real-time OLAP? Is there a real-time computing engine with its own storage, when the real-time data is entered,it can flexibly and freely calculate within a certain range, and has a certain data carrying capacity, and supports analysis of query responses at the same time? With the development of technology, the current MPP engine is developing very rapidly, and its performance is also improving rapidly, so there is a new possibility in this scenario, just like the Doris engine we use here.\\n\\nThis idea has been practiced in the industry and has become an important exploration direction. For example, Alibaba\'s real-time OLAP solution based on ADB, etc.\\n\\n### 2.Architecture Design of Real-time Data Warehouse\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the entire real-time data warehouse architecture, the first thing to consider is how to manage all real-time data, how to effectively integrate resources, and how to construct data.\\n\\nIn terms of methodology, the real-time and offline are very similar to each other. In the early stage of offline data warehouse, it is also case by case. Consider how to govern it when the scale of data increases to a certain amount. We all know that layering is a very effective way of data governing. So, on the issue of how to manage the real-time data warehouse, the first consideration is also the hierarchical processing logic, as follows:\\n\\n- Data source: At the data source level, offline and real-time data sources are consistent. They are mainly divided into log classes and business classes. Log classes include user logs, DB logs, and server logs.\\n\\n- Real-time detail layer: At the detail level, in order to solve the problem of repeated construction, a unified construction should be carried out.Using the offline data warehouse model to build a unified basic detailed data layer, managed according to the theme, the purpose of the detail layer is to provide directly available data downstream, so the basic layer should be processed uniformly, such as cleaning, filtering, and dimension expansion.\\n\\n- Aggregation layer: The summary layer can directly calculate the result through the concise operator of Flink or Storm. And form a summary of indicators, all indicators are processed at the summary layer, and everyone manages and constructs according to unified specifications, forming a reusable summary result.\\n\\nIn conclusion, from the perspective of the construction of the entire real-time data warehouse,first of all, the data construction needs to be layered, build the framework first, and set the specifications includs  what extent each layer is processed and how each layer is used.The definition of specifications facilitates standardized processing in production.Due to the need to ensure timeliness, don\'t design too many layers when designing.For scenarios with high real-time requirements, you can basically refer to the left side of the figure above. For batch processing requirements, you can import from the real-time detail layer to the real-time OLAP engine, and perform fast retraction calculations based on the OLAP engine\'s own calculation and query capabilities, as shown in the data flow on the right side of the figure above.\\n\\n# Real-time platform construction\\n\\nAfter the architecture is determined, the next consideration is how to build a platform.The construction of the real-time platform is completely attached to the real-time data warehouse management.\\n\\nFirst, abstract the functions and abstract them into components, so that standardized production can be achieved, and systematic guarantees can be further constructed. For the basic processing layer cleaning, filtering, confluence, dimension expansion, conversion, encryption, screening and other functions can be abstracted, and the base layer builds a directly usable data result stream in this componentized way. How to meet diverse needs and how to be compatible with users are the problems that we need to figure out. In this case it may occur problems with redundant processing. In terms of storage, real-time data does not have a history and will not consume too much storage. This redundancy is acceptable.The production efficiency can be improved by means of redundancy, which is an ideological application of changing space for time.\\n\\nThrough the processing of the base layer, all data is deposited in the IDL layer, and written to the base layer of the OLAP engine at the same time, and then the real-time summary layer is calculated. Based on Storm, Flink or Doris, multi-dimensional summary indicators are produced to form a unified summary layer for unified storage distribution.\\n\\nWhen these functions are available, system capabilities such as metadata management, indicator management, data security, SLA, and data quality will be gradually built.\\n\\n### 1.Real-time base layer functions\\n\\nThe construction of the real-time base layer needs to solve some problems.\\n\\nThe first is the problem of repeated reading of a stream. When a Binlog is called, it exists in the form of a DB package. Users may only use one of the tables. If everyone wants to use it, there may be a problem that everyone needs to access this stream. The solution can be deconstructed according to different businesses, restored to the basic data flow layer, made into a paradigm structure according to the needs of the business, and integrated with the theme construction according to the modeling method of the data warehouse.\\n\\nSecondly, we need to encapsulate components, such as basic layer cleaning, filtering, and dimension expansion . Users can write logic by a very simple expression. Trans part is more flexible. For example, converting from one value to another value, for this custom logic expression, we also open custom components, which can develop custom scripts through Java or Python for data processing.\\n\\n### 2.Real-time feature production capabilities\\n\\nFeature production can be expressed logically through SQL syntax, and the underlying logic is adapted, and transparently transmitted to the computing engine, shielding the user\'s dependence on the computing engine.Just like for offline scenarios, currently large companies rarely develop through code, unless there are some special cases, so they can basically be expressed in SQL.\\n\\nAt the functional level, the idea of indicator management is integrated. Atomic indicators, derived indicators, standard calculation apertures, dimension selection, window settings and other operations can be configured in a configurable way.In this way, the production logic can be uniformly parsed and packaged uniformly.\\n\\nAnother question,with the same source code a lot of SQL is written, and each submission will have a data stream which is a waste of resources.Our solution is to produce dynamic metrics through the same data stream, so that metrics can be added dynamically without stopping the service.\\n\\nSo, during the construction of the real-time platform, engineers should consider more about how to use resources more effectively and which links can use resources more economically.\\n\\n### 3.SLA construction\\n\\nSLA mainly solves two problems, one is about the end-to-end SLA, the other is  about the SLA of job productivity. We adopt the method of burying points + reporting.Because the real-time stream is relatively large, the burying point should be as simple as possible, do not bury too many things,can express the business information is enough.The output of each job is reported to the SLA monitoring platform in a unified manner, and the required information is reported at each job point through a unified interface, and finally the end-to-end SLA can be counted.\\n\\nIn real-time production, because the process is very long, it is impossible to control all links, but it can control the efficiency of its own operations, so job SLA is also essential.\\n\\n### 4.Real-time OLAP solution\\n\\nProblems:\\n\\n- Binlog business restoration is complex\uff1aThere are many changes in the business, and changes at a certain point in time are required. Therefore, sorting and data storage are required, which consumes a lot of memory and CPU resources.\\n\\n- Binlog business association is complex\uff1aIn stream computing, the relationship between streams and streams is very difficult to express business logic.\\n\\nsolutions\uff1a\\n\\nTo solve the problem through the OLAP engine with computing power, there is no need to logically map a data stream, and only the problem of real-time and stable data storage needs to be solved.\\n\\nWe use Doris as a high-performance OLAP engine here.Due to the need for derivative calculations between the results generated by the business data and the results, Doris can quickly restore the business by using the unique model or the aggregation model, and can also perform aggregation at the summary layer while restoring the business,and is also designed for reuse.The application layer can be physical or logical view.\\n\\nThis mode focuses on solving the business rollback calculation. For example, when the business state changes, the value needs to be changed at a certain point in history. The cost of using flow calculation in this scenario is very high. The OLAP mode can solve this problem very well.\\n\\n# Real-time use cases\\n\\nIn the end, we use a case to illustrate.For example, merchants want to offer discounts to users based on the number of historical orders placed by users. Merchants need to see how many orders they have placed in history. They must have historical T+1 data and real-time data today.This scenario is a typical Lambda architecture,You can design a partition table in Doris, one is the historical partition, and the other is the today partition. The historical partition can be produced offline. Today\'s indicators can be calculated in real time and written to today\'s partition. When querying, a simple summary.\\n\\nThis scenario seems relatively simple, but the difficulty lies in the fact that many simple problems will become complicated after the number of merchants increases.Therefore, in the future, we will use more business input to precipitate more business scenarios, abstract them to form a unified production plan and function, and support diversified business needs with minimized real-time computing resources, which is also what needs to be achieved in the future. \\n\\nThat\'s all for today, thank you.\\n\\n### about the author:\\n\\nZhu Liang, more than 5 years experience in data warehouse construction in traditional industries, 6 years experience in Internet data warehouse, technical direction involves offline, real-time data warehouse management, systematic capacity building, OLAP system and engine, big data related technologies, focusing on OLAP,and real-time technology frontier development trends.The business direction involves ad hoc query, operation analysis, strategy report product, user portrait, crowd recommendation, experimental evaluation, etc."},{"id":"/xiaomi","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/xiaomi","source":"@site/blog/xiaomi.md","title":"Best Practice of Apache Doris in Xiaomi Group","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2022-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 20, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Best Practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/best-practice"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Apache Doris"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Best Practice of Apache Doris in Xiaomi Group","summary":"In order to improve the query performance of the Xiaomi growth analysis platform and reduce the operation and maintenance costs, Xiaomi Group introduced Apache Doris in September 2019.

In the past two and a half years, **Apache Doris has been widely used in Xiaomi Group,** **such as business growth analytic platform, realtime dashboards for all business groups,  finance analysis, user profile analysis, advertising reports, A/B testing platform and so on.** This article will share the best practice of Apache Doris in Xiaomi Group. \\n\\n# Business Practice\\n\\nThe typical business practices of Apache Doris in Xiaomi are as follows:\\n\\n## 01 User Access\\n\\nData Factory is a one-stop data development platform developed by Xiaomi for data developers and data analysts. This platform supports data sources such as Doris, Hive, Kudu, Iceberg, ES, Talso, TiDB, MySQL, etc. It also supports computing engines such as Flink, Spark,  Presto,etc.\\n\\nInside Xiaomi, users need to access the Doris service through the data factory. Users need to register in the data factory and complete the approval for building the database. The Doris operation and maintenance classmates will connect according to the descriptions of the business scenarios and data usage expectations submitted by users in the data factory. After completing the access approval, users can use the Doris service to perform operations such as visual table creation and data import in the data factory.\\n\\n## 02 Data import\\n\\nIn Xiaomi\'s business, the two most common ways to import data into Doris are Stream Load and Broker Load. User data will be divided into real-time data and offline data, and users\' real-time and offline data will generally be written to Talos first (Talos is a distributed, high-throughput message queue developed by Xiaomi). The offline data from Talos will be sink to HDFS, and then imported to Doris through the data factory. Users can directly submit Broker Load tasks in the data factory to import large batches of data on HDFS into Doris, In addition, you can run the SparkSQL command in the data factory to query data from Hive, Import the data found in SparkSQL into Doris through Spark-doris-Connector, and encapsulate Stream Load at the bottom layer of Spark-doris-Connector. Real-time data from Talos is generally imported into Doris in two ways. One is to first perform ETL on the data through Flink, and then import small batches of data to Doris through.Flink- Doris-connector encapsulates the Stream Load at the bottom layer. Another way is to import small batches of data into Doris through Stream Load encapsulated by Spark Streaming at regular intervals.\\n\\n## 03 Data Query\\n\\nDoris users of Xiaomi generally analyze and query Doris and display the results through the ShuJing platform.ShuJing is a general-purpose BI analysis tool developed by Xiaomi. Users can query and visualize Doris through ShuJing  platform, and realize user behavior analysis (in order to meet the needs of business event analysis, retention analysis, funnel analysis, path analysis and other behavior analysis needs, We added corresponding UDF and UDAF ) and user profile analysis for Doris.\\n\\n## 04 Compaction Tuning\\n\\nFor Doris, each data import will generate a data version under the relevant data shard (Tablet) of the storage layer, and the Compaction mechanism will asynchronously merge the smaller data versions generated by the import (the detailed principle of the Compaction mechanism can be Refer to the previous article \\"Doris Compaction Mechanism Analysis\\").\\n\\nXiaomi has many high-frequency, high-concurrency, near-real-time import business scenarios, and a large number of small versions will be generated in a short period of time. If Compaction does not merge data versions in time, it will cause version accumulation.On the one hand, too many minor versions will increase the pressure on metadata, and on the other hand, too many versions will affect query performance.In Xiaomi\'s usage scenarios, many tables use the Unique and Aggregate data models, and the query performance is heavily dependent on whether Compaction can merge data versions in time.In our business scenario, the query performance was reduced by tens of times due to delayed version merging, thus affecting online services.When a Compaction happens, it consumes CPU, memory, and disk I/O resources. Too much compaction will take up too many machine resources, affect query performance, and may cause OOM.\\n\\n**In response to this problem of Compaction, we first start from the business side and guide users through the following aspects:**\\n\\n- Set reasonable partitions and buckets for tables to avoid generating too many data fragments.\\n\\n- Standardize the user\'s data import operation, reduce the frequency of data import, increase the amount of data imported in a single time, and reduce the pressure of Compaction.\\n\\n- Avoid using delete operations too much.The delete operation will generate a delete version under the relevant data shard in the storage layer.The Cumulative Compaction task will be truncated when the delete version is encountered. This task can only merge the data version after the Cumulative Point and before the delete version, move the Cumulative Point to the delete version, and hand over the delete version to the subsequent Base Compaction task. to process. If you use the delete operation too much, too many delete versions will be generated under the Tablet, which will cause the Cumulative Compaction task to slow down the progress of version merging. Using the delete operation does not actually delete the data from the disk, but records the deletion conditions in the delete version. When the data is queried, the deleted data will be filtered out by Merge-On-Read. Only the delete version is merged by the Base Compaction task. After that, the data to be deleted by the delete operation can be cleared from the disk as expired data with the Stale Rowset. If you need to delete the data of an entire partition, you can use the truncated partition operation instead of the delete operation.\\n\\n**Second, we tuned Compaction from the operation and maintenance side:**\\n\\n- According to different business scenarios, different Compaction parameters (Compaction strategy, number of threads, etc.) are configured for different clusters.\\n\\n- Appropriately lowers the priority of the Base Compaction task and increases the priority of the Cumulative Compaction task, because the Base Compaction task takes a long time to execute and has serious write amplification problems, while the Cumulative Compaction task executes faster and can quickly merge a large number of small versions.\\n\\n- Version backlog alarm, dynamic adjustment of Compaction parameters.When the Compaction Producer produces Compaction tasks, it will update the corresponding metric.It records the value of the largest Compaction Score on the BE node. You can check the trend of this indicator through Grafana to determine whether there is a version backlog. In addition, we have added a Version backlog alert.In order to facilitate the adjustment of Compaction parameters, we have optimized the code level to support dynamic adjustment of the Compaction strategy and the number of Compaction threads at runtime, avoiding the need to restart the process when adjusting the Compaction parameters.\\n\\n- Supports manual triggering of the Compaction task of the specified Table and data shards under the specified Partition, and improves the Compaction priority of the specified Table and data shards under the specified Partition.\\n\\n# Monitoring and Alarm Management\\n\\n## 01 Monitoring System\\n\\nPrometheus will regularly pull Metrics metrics from Doris\'s FE and BE and display them in the Grafana monitoring panel.The service metadata based on QingZhou Warehouse will be automatically registered in Zookeeper, and Prometheus will regularly pull the latest cluster metadata information from Zookeeper and display it dynamically in the Grafana monitoring panel.\uff08Qingzhou Data Warehouse is a data warehouse constructed by the Qingzhou platform based on the operation data of Xiaomi\'s full-scale big data service. It consists of 2 base tables and 30+ dimension tables.Covers the whole process data such as resources, server cmdb, cost, process status and so on when big data components are running\uff09We have also added statistics and display boards for common troubleshooting data such as Doris large query list, real-time write data volume, data import transaction numbers, etc. in Grafana.In Grafana, we also added statistics and display boards for common troubleshooting data such as the Doris big query list, the amount of real-time data written, and the number of data import transactions, so that alarms can be linked. When the cluster is abnormal, Doris\' operation and maintenance students can locate the cause of the cluster failure in the shortest time.\\n\\n## 02  Falcon \\n\\nFalcon is a monitoring and alarm system widely used inside Xiaomi.Because Doris provides a relatively complete metrics interface, which can easily provide monitoring functions based on Prometheus and Grafana, we only use Falcon\'s alarm function in the Doris service.For different levels of faults in Doris, we define alarms as three levels of P0, P1 and P2:\\n\\n- P2 alarm (alarm level is low): single node failure alarm.When a single node indicator or process status is abnormal, an alarm is generally issued as a P2 level.The alarm information is sent to the members of the alarm group in the form of Xiaomi Office messages.(Xiaomi Office is a privatized deployment product of ByteDance Feishu in Xiaomi, and its functions are similar to Feishu.)\\n\\n- P1 alarm (alarm level is higher):In a short period of time (within 3 minutes), the cluster will issue a P1 level alarm if there are short-term exceptions such as increased query delay and abnormal writing,etc.The alarm information is sent to the members of the alarm group in the form of Xiaomi Office messages.P1 level alarms require Oncall engineers to respond and provide feedback.\\n\\n- P0 alarm (alarm level is high):In a long period of time (more than 3 minutes), the cluster will issue a P0 level alarm if there are exceptions such as increased query delay and abnormal writing,etc.Alarm information is sent in the form of Xiaomi office messages and phone alarms.P0 level alarm requires Oncall engineers to respond within 1 minute and coordinate resources for failure recovery and review preparation.\\n\\n## 03  Cloud-Doris \\n\\ncloud-Doris is a data collection component developed by Xiaomi for the internal Doris service. Its main capability is to detect the availability of the Doris service and collect the cluster indicator data of internal concern.For example, Cloud-Doris can periodically simulate users reading and writing to the Doris system to detect the availability of services.If the cluster has abnormal availability, it will be alerted through Falcon.Collect user\'s read and write data, and then generate user bill.Collect information such as table-level data volume, unhealthy copies, and oversized Tablets, and send alarms to abnormal information through Falcon.\\n\\n## 04 QingZhou inspection\\n\\nFor chronic hidden dangers such as capacity, user growth, resource allocation, etc., we use the unified QingZhou big data service inspection platform for inspection and reporting.The inspection generally consists of two parts:Service-specific inspections and basic indicator inspections.Among them, the service-specific inspection refers to the indicators that are unique to each big data service and cannot be used universally.For Doris, it mainly includes: Quota, number of shard copies, number of single table columns, number of table partitions, etc.By increasing the inspection method, the chronic hidden dangers that are difficult to be alarmed in advance can be well avoided, which provides support for the failure-free major festivals.\\n\\n# Failure Recovery\\n\\nWhen an online cluster fails, the first principle should be to quickly restore services.If the cause of the failure is clear, handle it according to the specific cause and restore the service.If the cause of the failure is not clear, you should try restarting the process as soon as you keep the snapshot to restore the service.\\n\\n## 01 Access Failures Handling\\n\\nDoris uses Xiaomi LVS as the access layer, which is similar to the LB service of open source or public cloud, and provides layer 4 or layer 7 traffic load scheduling capability.After Doris binds a reasonable port,Generally speaking, if an abnormality occurs in a single FE node, it will be automatically kicked out, and the service can be restored without the user\'s perception, and an alarm will be issued for the abnormal node.Of course, for FE faults that cannot be processed in a short time, we will first adjust the weight of the faulty node to 0 or delete the abnormal node from LVS first to prevent unpredictable problems caused by process detection exceptions.\\n\\n## 02 Node Failure Handling\\n\\nFor FE node failures, if the cause of the failure cannot be quickly located, it is generally necessary to keep thread snapshots and memory snapshots and restart the process.\\n\\n```undefined\\njstack \u8fdb\u7a0bID >> \u5feb\u7167\u6587\u4ef6\u540d.jstack\\n```\\n\\nSave a memory snapshot of FE with the command:\\n\\n```undefined\\njmap -dump:live,format=b,file=\u5feb\u7167\u6587\u4ef6\u540d.heap \u8fdb\u7a0bID\\n```\\n\\nIn the case of version upgrade or some unexpected scenarios, the image of the FE node may have abnormal metadata, and the abnormal metadata may be synchronized to other FE, resulting in all FE not working.Once a failed image is discovered, the fastest recovery option is to use Recovery mode to stop FE elections and replace the failed image with the backup image.Of course, it is not easy to backup images all the time.Since this failure is common in cluster upgrades, we recommend adding simple local image backup logic to the cluster upgrade procedure.Ensure that a copy of the current and latest image data will be retained before each upgrade starts the FE process.For BE node failure, if the process crashes, a core file will be generated, and minos will automatically pull the process;If the task is stuck, you need to restart the process after retaining the thread snapshot with the following command:\\n\\n```undefined\\npstack \u8fdb\u7a0bID >> \u5feb\u7167\u6587\u4ef6\u540d.pstack\\n```\\n\\n# Concluding Remarks\\n\\nApache Doris has been widely used by Xiaomi since the first use of open source software Apache Doris by Xiaomi Group in September 2019.At present, it has served dozens of businesses of Xiaomi, with dozens of clusters and hundreds of nodes, and a set of data ecology with Apache Doris as the core has been formed within Xiaomi.In order to improve the efficiency of operation and maintenance, Xiaomi has also developed a complete set of automated management and operation and maintenance systems around Doris.With the increasing number of services, Doris also exposed some problems. For example, there was no better resource isolation mechanism in the past version, and services would affect each other. In addition, system monitoring needs to be further improved.With the rapid development of the community, more and more small partners have participated in the community construction, the vectorized engine has been transformed, the transformation of the query optimizer is in full swing, and Apache Doris is gradually maturing."},{"id":"/1.1 Release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/1.1 Release","source":"@site/blog/1.1 Release.md","title":"Apache Doris announced the official release of version 1.1","description":"Dear community, we are pleased to announce that we have officially released Apache Doris 1.1 on July 14, 2022!

This is the first release version after Apache Doris graduated from the Apache incubator and became an Apache Top-Level Project.\\n\\nIn version 1.1, we realized the full vectorization of the computing layer and storage layer, and officially enabled the vectorized execution engine as a stable function. All queries are executed by the vectorized execution engine by default, and the performance is 3-5 times higher than the previous version. It increases the ability to access the external tables of Apache Iceberg and supports federated query of data in Doris and Iceberg, and expands the analysis capabilities of Apache Doris on the data lake; on the basis of the original LZ4, the ZSTD compression algorithm is added , further improves the data compression rate; fixed many performance and stability problems in previous versions, greatly improving system stability. Downloading and using is recommended.\\n\\n## Upgrade Notes\\n\\n### The vectorized execution engine is enabled by default\\n\\nIn version 1.0, we introduced the vectorized execution engine as an experimental feature and Users need to manually enable it when executing queries by configuring the session variables through `set batch_size = 4096` and `set enable_vectorized_engine = true` .\\n\\nIn version 1.1, we officially fully enabled the vectorized execution engine as a stable function. The session variable `enable_vectorized_engine` is set to true by default. All queries are executed by default through the vectorized execution engine.\\n\\n### BE Binary File Renaming\\n\\nBE binary file has been renamed from palo_be to doris_be . Please pay attention to modifying the relevant scripts if you used to rely on process names for cluster management and other operations.\\n\\n### Segment storage format upgrade\\n\\nThe storage format of earlier versions of Apache Doris was Segment V1. In version 0.12, we had implemented Segment V2 as a new storage format, which introduced Bitmap indexes, memory tables, page cache, dictionary compression, delayed materialization and many other features. Starting from version 0.13, the default storage format for newly created tables is Segment V2, while maintaining compatibility with the Segment V1 format.\\n\\nIn order to ensure the maintainability of the code structure and reduce the additional learning and development costs caused by redundant historical codes, we have decided to no longer support the Segment v1 storage format from the next version. It is expected that this part of the code will be deleted in the Apache Doris 1.2 version, and all users who are still using the Segment V1 storage format must complete the data format conversion in version 1.1. Please refer to the following link for the operation manual:\\n\\n[https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/1.0/administrator-guide/segment-v2-usage](https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/1.0/administrator-guide/segment-v2-usage)\\n\\n### Normal Upgrade\\n\\nFor normal upgrade operations, you can perform rolling upgrades according to the cluster upgrade documentation on the official website.\\n\\n[https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/admin-manual/cluster-management/upgrade](https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/admin-manual/cluster-management/upgrade)\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n### Support random distribution of data [experimental]\\n\\nIn some scenarios (such as log data analysis), users may not be able to find a suitable bucket key to avoid data skew, so the system needs to provide additional distribution methods to solve the problem.\\n\\nTherefore, when creating a table you can set `DISTRIBUTED BY random BUCKET number`to use random distribution, the data will be randomly written to a single tablet when importing to reduce the data fanout during the loading process. And reduce resource overhead and improve system stability.\\n\\n### Support for creating Iceberg external tables[experimental]\\n\\nIceberg external tables provide Apache Doris with direct access to data stored in Iceberg. Through Iceberg external tables, federated queries on data stored in local storage and Iceberg can be implemented, which saves tedious data loading work, simplifies the system architecture for data analysis, and performs more complex analysis operations.\\n\\nIn version 1.1, Apache Doris supports creating Iceberg external tables and querying data, and supports automatic synchronization of all table schemas in the Iceberg database through the REFRESH command.\\n\\n### Added ZSTD compression algorithm\\n\\nAt present, the data compression method in Apache Doris is uniformly specified by the system, and the default is LZ4. For some scenarios that are sensitive to data storage costs, the original data compression ratio requirements cannot be met.\\n\\nIn version 1.1, users can set \\"compression\\"=\\"zstd\\" in the table properties to specify the compression method as ZSTD when creating a table. In the 25GB 110 million lines of text log test data, the highest compression rate is nearly 10 times, which is 53% higher than the original compression rate, and the speed of reading data from disk and decompressing it is increased by 30%.\\n\\n## Improvements\\n\\n### More comprehensive vectorization support\\n\\nIn version 1.1, we implemented full vectorization of the compute and storage layers, including:\\n\\nImplemented vectorization of all built-in functions\\n\\nThe storage layer implements vectorization and supports dictionary optimization for low-cardinality string columns\\n\\nOptimized and resolved numerous performance and stability issues with the vectorization engine.\\n\\nWe tested the performance of Apache Doris version 1.1 and version 0.15 on the SSB and TPC-H standard test datasets:\\n\\nOn all 13 SQLs in the SSB test data set, version 1.1 is better than version 0.15, and the overall performance is improved by about 3 times, which solves the problem of performance degradation in some scenarios in version 1.0;\\n\\nOn all 22 SQLs in the TPC-H test data set, version 1.1 is better than version 0.15, the overall performance is improved by about 4.5 times, and the performance of some scenarios is improved by more than ten times;\\n\\n![](https://p3-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/edb59781b0f74ff08821467f23a63bad~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image)\\n\\n<p align=\'center\'>SSB \u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6</p>\\n\\n![](https://p3-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/e34377054f4448b3b367789a391f2122~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image)\\n\\n<p align=\'center\'>TPC-H \u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6</p>\\n\\n**Performance test report**\\n\\n[https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/benchmark/ssb](https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/benchmark/ssb)\\n\\n[https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/benchmark/tpch](https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/benchmark/tpch)\\n\\n### Compaction logic optimization and real-time guarantee\\n\\nIn Apache Doris, each commit will generate a data version. In high concurrent write scenarios, -235 errors are prone to occur due to too many data versions and untimely compaction, and query performance will also decrease accordingly.\\n\\nIn version 1.1, we introduced QuickCompaction, which will actively trigger compaction when the data version increases. At the same time, by improving the ability to scan fragment metadata, it can quickly find fragments with too many data versions and trigger compaction. Through active triggering and passive scanning, the real-time problem of data merging is completely solved.\\n\\nAt the same time, for high-frequency small file cumulative compaction, the scheduling and isolation of compaction tasks is implemented to prevent the heavyweight base compaction from affecting the merging of new data.\\n\\nFinally, for the merging of small files, the strategy of merging small files is optimized, and the method of gradient merging is adopted. Each time the files participating in the merging belong to the same data magnitude, it prevents versions with large differences in size from merging, and gradually merges hierarchically. , reducing the number of times a single file participates in merging, which can greatly save the CPU consumption of the system.\\n\\nWhen the data upstream maintains a write frequency of 10w per second (20 concurrent write tasks, 5000 rows per job, and checkpoint interval of 1s), version 1.1 behaves as follows:\\n\\n-   Quick data consolidation: Tablet version remains below 50 and compaction score is stable. Compared with the -235 problem that frequently occurred during high concurrent writing in the previous version, the compaction merge efficiency has been improved by more than 10 times.\\n\\n-   Significantly reduced CPU resource consumption: The strategy has been optimized for small file Compaction. In the above scenario of high concurrent writing, CPU resource consumption is reduced by 25%;\\n\\n-   Stable query time consumption: The overall orderliness of data is improved, and the fluctuation of query time consumption is greatly reduced. The query time consumption during high concurrent writing is the same as that of only querying, and the query performance is improved by 3-4 times compared with the previous version.\\n\\n### Read efficiency optimization for Parquet and ORC files\\n\\nBy adjusting arrow parameters, arrow\'s multi-threaded read capability is used to speed up Arrow\'s reading of each row_group, and it is modified to SPSC model to reduce the cost of waiting for the network through prefetching. After optimization, the performance of Parquet file import is improved by 4 to 5 times.\\n\\n### Safer metadata Checkpoint\\n\\nBy double-checking the image files generated after the metadata checkpoint and retaining the function of historical image files, the problem of metadata corruption caused by image file errors is solved.\\n\\n## Bugfix\\n\\n### Fix the problem that the data cannot be queried due to the missing data version.(Serious)\\n\\nThis issue was introduced in version 1.0 and may result in the loss of data versions for multiple replicas.\\n\\n### Fix the problem that the resource isolation is invalid for the resource usage limit of loading tasks (Moderate)\\n\\nIn 1.1, the broker load and routine load will use Backends with specified resource tags to do the load.\\n\\n### Use HTTP BRPC to transfer network data packets over 2GB (Moderate)\\n\\nIn the previous version, when the data transmitted between Backends through BRPC exceeded 2GB,\\nit may cause data transmission errors.\\n\\n## Others\\n\\n### Disabling Mini Load\\n\\nThe `/_load` interface is disabled by default, please use `the /_stream_load` interface uniformly.\\nOf course, you can re-enable it by turning off the FE configuration item `disable_mini_load`.\\n\\nThe Mini Load interface will be completely removed in version 1.2.\\n\\n### Completely disable the SegmentV1 storage format\\n\\nData in SegmentV1 format is no longer allowed to be created. Existing data can continue to be accessed normally.\\nYou can use the `ADMIN SHOW TABLET STORAGE FORMAT` statement to check whether the data in SegmentV1 format\\nstill exists in the cluster. And convert to SegmentV2 through the data conversion command\\n\\nAccess to SegmentV1 data will no longer be supported in version 1.2.\\n\\n### Limit the maximum length of String type\\n\\nIn previous versions, String types were allowed a maximum length of 2GB.\\nIn version 1.1, we will limit the maximum length of the string type to 1MB. Strings longer than this length cannot be written anymore.\\nAt the same time, using the String type as a partitioning or bucketing column of a table is no longer supported.\\n\\nThe String type that has been written can be accessed normally.\\n\\n### Fix fastjson related vulnerabilities\\n\\nUpdate to Canal version to fix fastjson security vulnerability.\\n\\n### Added `ADMIN DIAGNOSE TABLET` command\\n\\nUsed to quickly diagnose problems with the specified tablet.\\n\\n## Download to Use\\n\\n### Download Link\\n\\n[hhttps://doris.apache.org/download](https://doris.apache.org/download)\\n\\n### Feedback\\n\\nIf you encounter any problems with use, please feel free to contact us through GitHub discussion forum or Dev e-mail group anytime.\\n\\nGitHub Forum: [https://github.com/apache/doris/discussions](https://github.com/apache/doris/discussions)\\n\\nMailing list: [dev@doris.apache.org](dev@doris.apache.org)\\n\\n## Thanks\\n\\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this release:\\n\\n```\\n\\n@adonis0147\\n\\n@airborne12\\n\\n@amosbird\\n\\n@aopangzi\\n\\n@arthuryangcs\\n\\n@awakeljw\\n\\n@BePPPower\\n\\n@BiteTheDDDDt\\n\\n@bridgeDream\\n\\n@caiconghui\\n\\n@cambyzju\\n\\n@ccoffline\\n\\n@chenlinzhong\\n\\n@daikon12\\n\\n@DarvenDuan\\n\\n@dataalive\\n\\n@dataroaring\\n\\n@deardeng\\n\\n@Doris-Extras\\n\\n@emerkfu\\n\\n@EmmyMiao87\\n\\n@englefly\\n\\n@Gabriel39\\n\\n@GoGoWen\\n\\n@gtchaos\\n\\n@HappenLee\\n\\n@hello-stephen\\n\\n@Henry2SS\\n\\n@hewei-nju\\n\\n@hf200012\\n\\n@jacktengg\\n\\n@jackwener\\n\\n@Jibing-Li\\n\\n@JNSimba\\n\\n@kangshisen\\n\\n@Kikyou1997\\n\\n@kylinmac\\n\\n@Lchangliang\\n\\n@leo65535\\n\\n@liaoxin01\\n\\n@liutang123\\n\\n@lovingfeel\\n\\n@luozenglin\\n\\n@luwei16\\n\\n@luzhijing\\n\\n@mklzl\\n\\n@morningman\\n\\n@morrySnow\\n\\n@nextdreamblue\\n\\n@Nivane\\n\\n@pengxiangyu\\n\\n@qidaye\\n\\n@qzsee\\n\\n@SaintBacchus\\n\\n@SleepyBear96\\n\\n@smallhibiscus\\n\\n@spaces-X\\n\\n@stalary\\n\\n@starocean999\\n\\n@steadyBoy\\n\\n@SWJTU-ZhangLei\\n\\n@Tanya-W\\n\\n@tarepanda1024\\n\\n@tianhui5\\n\\n@Userwhite\\n\\n@wangbo\\n\\n@wangyf0555\\n\\n@weizuo93\\n\\n@whutpencil\\n\\n@wsjz\\n\\n@wunan1210\\n\\n@xiaokang\\n\\n@xinyiZzz\\n\\n@xlwh\\n\\n@xy720\\n\\n@yangzhg\\n\\n@Yankee24\\n\\n@yiguolei\\n\\n@yinzhijian\\n\\n@yixiutt\\n\\n@zbtzbtzbt\\n\\n@zenoyang\\n\\n@zhangstar333\\n\\n@zhangyifan27\\n\\n@zhannngchen\\n\\n@zhengshengjun\\n\\n@zhengshiJ\\n\\n@zingdle\\n\\n@zuochunwei\\n\\n@zy-kkk\\n```"},{"id":"/Annoucing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Annoucing","source":"@site/blog/Annoucing.md","title":"Announcing Open Source Realtime Analytical database Apache Doris as a Top-Level Project","description":"Apache Doris is a modern, high-performance and real-time analytical database based on MPP.

It was donated by Baidu to Apache foundation for incubation in July 2018, and then incubated and operated by members of the podling project management committee\uff08PPMC\uff09under the guidance of Apache incubator mentors.\\n\\nWe are very proud that Doris graduated from Apache incubator successfully. It is an important milestone. In the whole incubating period, with the guidance of Apache Way and the help of incubator mentors, we learned how to develop our project and community in Apache Way, and have achieved great growth in this process.\\n\\nAt present, Apache Doris community has gathered more than 300 contributors from nearly 100 enterprises in different industries, and the number of active contributors per month is close to 100. During the incubation period, Apache Doris released a total of 8 major versions and completed many major functions, including storage engine upgrade, vectorization execution engine and so on, and released 1.0 version. It is the strength of these open source contributors that makes Apache Doris achieve today\'s results.\\n\\nAt the same time, Apache Doris now has a wide range of users in China and even around the world. Up to now, Apache Doris has been applied in the production environment of more than 500 enterprises around the world. Among the top 50 Internet companies in China by market value or valuation, more than 80% are long-term users of Apache Doris, including Baidu, Meituan, Xiaomi, JD, ByteDance, Tencent, Kwai, Netease, Sina, 360 and other well-known companies. It also has rich applications in some traditional industries, such as finance, energy, manufacturing, telecommunications and other fields.\\n\\nYou can quickly build a simple, easy-to-use and powerful data analysis platform based on Apache Doris, which is very easy to start, and the learning cost is very low. In addition, the distributed architecture of Apache Doris is very simple, which can greatly reduce the workload of system operation and maintenance. This is also the key factor for more and more users to choose Apache Doris.\\n\\nAs a mature analytical database project, Apache Doris has the following advantages:\\n\\n-   Excellent performance: it is equipped with an efficient column storage engine, which not only reduces the amount of data scanning, but also implements an ultra-high data compression ratio. At the same time, Doris also provides a rich index structure to speed up data reading and filtering. Using the partition and bucket pruning function, Doris can support ultra-high concurrency of online service business, and a single node can support up to thousands of QPS. Further, Apache Doris combines the vectorization execution engine to give full play to the modern CPU parallel computing power, supplemented by intelligent materialized view technology to accelerate pre-aggregation, and can simultaneously carry out planning based and cost based query optimization through the query optimizer. Through the above methods, Doris can reach ultimate query performance.\\n\\n-   Easy to use: it supports ANSI SQL syntax, including single table aggregation, sorting, filtering and multi table join, sub query, etc. it also supports complex SQL syntax such as window function and grouping set. At the same time, users can expand system functions through UDF, UDAF and other user-defined functions. In addition, Apache Doris is also compatible with MySQL protocol. Users can access Doris through various client tools and support seamless connection with BI tools.\\n\\n-   Streamlined architecture: the system has only two modules \u2014\u2014 frontend (FE) and backend (BE). The FE node is responsible for the access of user requests, the analysis of query plans, metadata storage and cluster management, and the BE node is responsible for the implementation of data storage and query plans. It is a complete distributed database management system. Users can run the Apache Doris cluster without installing any third-party management and control components, and the deployment and upgrade process are very simple. At the same time, any module can support horizontal expansion, and the cluster can be expanded up to hundreds of nodes, supporting the storage of more than 10PB of ultra large scale data.\\n\\n-   Scalability and reliability: it supports the storage of multiple replicas of data. The cluster is able to self-healing. Its own distributed management framework can automatically manage the distribution, repair and balance of data replicas. When the replicas are damaged, the system can automatically perceive and repair them. When a node is expanded, it can be completed with only one SQL command, and the data replicas will be automatically rebalanced among nodes without manual intervention or operation. Whether it is capacity expansion, capacity reduction, single node failure or upgrading, the system does not need to stop running, and can normally provide stable and reliable online services.\\n\\n-   Ecological enrichment: It provides rich data synchronisation methods, supports fast loading of data from localhost, Hadoop, Flink, Spark, Kafka, SeaTunnel and other systems, and can also directly access data in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, S3, Hive, Iceberg, Elasticsearch and other systems without data replication. At the same time, the data stored in Doris can also be read by Spark and Flink, and can be output to the upstream data application for display and analysis.\\n\\nGraduation is not the ultimate goal, it is the starting point of a new journey. In the past, our goal of launching Doris was to provide more people with better data analysis tools and solve their data analysis problems. Becoming an Apache top-level project is not only an affirmation of the hard work of all contributors to the Apache Doris community in the past, but also means that we have established a strong, prosperous and sustainable open source community under the guidance of Apache Way.In the future, we will continue to operate the community in the Way of Apache. I believe we will attract more excellent open source contributors to participate in the community, and the community will further grow with the help of all contributors.\\n\\nApache Doris will carry out more challenging and meaningful work in the future, including new query optimizer, support for Lakehouse integration, and architecture evolution for cloud infrastructure. More open source technology enthusiasts are welcome to join the Apache Doris community and grow together.\\n\\nOnce again, we sincerely thank all contributors who participated in the construction of Apache Doris community and all users who use Apache Doris and constantly put forward improvement suggestions. At the same time, we also thank our incubator mentors, IPMC members and friends in various open source project communities who have continuously encouraged, supported and helped us all the way.\\n\\n**Apache Doris GitHub\uff1a**\\n\\n[https://github.com/apache/doris](https://github.com/apache/doris)\\n\\n**Apache Doris website:**\\n\\n[http://doris.apache.org](http://doris.apache.org)\\n\\n**Please contact us via:**\\n\\n[dev@doris.apache.org.](dev@doris.apache.org.)\\n\\n**See How to subscribe:**\\n\\n[https://doris.apache.org/community/subscribe-mail-list](https://doris.apache.org/community/subscribe-mail-list/)"},{"id":"/release-note-1.0.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-note-1.0.0","source":"@site/blog/release-note-1.0.0.md","title":"[Release Note] Apache Doris(Incubating) 1.0.0 Release","description":"\x3c!--","date":"2022-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 18, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Release Notes","permalink":"/blog/tags/release-notes"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Apache Doris"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"[Release Note] Apache Doris(Incubating) 1.0.0 Release","summary":"[Release Note] Apache Doris(Incubating) 1.0.0 Release","date":"2022-04-18","author":"Apache Doris","tags":["Release Notes"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Announcing Open Source Realtime Analytical database Apache Doris as a Top-Level Project","permalink":"/blog/Annoucing"},"nextItem":{"title":"[Release Note] Apache Doris(Incubating) 0.15.0 Release","permalink":"/blog/release-note-0.15.0"}},"content":"\x3c!--\\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\\nor more contributor license agreements.

Here we would like to especially thank the small partners from SIG (Special Interest Group) such as **vectorized execution engine, query optimizer, and visual operation and maintenance platform**. Since the establishment of the Apache Doris Community SIG group in August 2021, data from more than ten companies including Baidu, Meituan, Xiaomi, JD, Shuhai, ByteDance, Tencent, NetEase, Alibaba, PingCAP, Nebula Graph, etc. Ten contributors** joined the SIG as the first members, and for the first time completed the development of such major functions as the vectorized execution engine, query optimizer, and Doris Manager visual monitoring operation and maintenance platform in the form of open source collaboration of special groups. **During more than half a year, conducting technical research and sharing dozens of times, holding nearly 100 remote meetings, accumulatively submitting hundreds of Commits, involving more than 100,000 lines of code**, it is precisely because of their contributions , only the 1.0 version came out, let us once again express our most sincere thanks for their hard work!\\n\\nAt the same time, the number of Apache Doris contributors has exceeded 300, the number of monthly active contributors has exceeded 60, and the average weekly number of Commits submitted in recent weeks has also exceeded 80. The scale and activity of developers gathered by the community There has been a huge improvement. We are very much looking forward to having more small partners participate in the community contribution, and work with us to build Apache Doris into the world\'s top analytical database. We also hope that all small partners can reap valuable growth with us.

There was unnecessary overhead in performing SQL operator and function operations, which led to the limited efficiency of the Apache Doris execution engine, which did not Adapt to the architecture of modern CPUs. The goal of the vectorized execution engine is to replace the current row-based SQL execution engine of Apache Doris, fully release the computing power of modern CPUs, break through the performance limitations on the SQL execution engine, and exert extreme performance.\\n\\nBased on the characteristics of modern CPUs and the execution characteristics of the volcano model, the vectorized execution engine redesigned the SQL execution engine in the columnar storage system:\\n\\n- Reorganized the data structure of memory, replaced Tuple with Column, improved Cache affinity, branch prediction and prefetch memory friendliness during calculation\\n- Type judgment is performed in batches. In this batch, the type determined during type judgment is used, and the virtual function cost of type judgment of each line is allocated to the batch level.\\n- Through batch-level type judgment, virtual function calls are eliminated, allowing the compiler to have the opportunity for function inlining and SIMD optimization\\n\\nThis greatly improves the efficiency of the CPU when executing SQL and improves the performance of SQL queries.\\n\\nIn Apache Doris version 1.0, enabling the vectorized execution engine with set batch_size = 4096 and set enable_vectorized_engine = true can significantly improve query performance in most cases. Under the SSB and OnTime standard test datasets, the overall performance of the two scenarios of multi-table association and wide-column query is improved by 3 times and 2.6 times respectively.\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/1.0/1.0.0-1.png)\\n\\n![](/images/blogs/1.0/1.0.0-2.png)\\n\\n### Lateral View Grammar [Experimental]\\n\\nThrough Lateral View syntax, we can use Table Function table functions such as explode_bitmap, explode_split, explode_jaon_array, etc., to expand bitmap, String or Json Array from one column into multiple rows, so that the expanded data can be further processed (such as Filter, Join, etc.) .\\n\\n### Hive External Table [Experimental]\\n\\nHive External Table provides users with the ability to directly access Hive tables through Doris. External tables save the tedious data import work, and can use Doris\'s own OLAP capabilities to solve data analysis problems of Hive tables. The current version supports connecting Hive data sources to Doris, and supports federated queries through data in Doris and Hive data sources for more complex analysis operations.\\n\\n### Support Z-Order data sorting format\\n\\nApache Doris data is sorted and stored according to the prefix column, so when the prefix query condition is included, fast data search can be performed on the sorted data, but if the query condition is not a prefix column, the data sorting feature cannot be used for fast data search. The above problems can be solved by Z-Order Indexing. In version 1.0, we have added the Z-Order data sorting format, which can play a good filtering effect in the scenario of kanban multi-column query and accelerate the filtering performance of non-prefix column conditions. .\\n\\n### Support for Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) plugin\\n\\nApache SeaTunnel is a high-performance distributed data integration framework built on Apache Spark and Apache Flink.

Nearly 700 optimizations and fixes have been submitted by 99 contributors to Apache Doris, and we\'d like to express our sincere gratitude to all of them!\\n\\nIn the 0.15.0 Release, we have added many new features to optimize Apache Doris\'s query performance, ease of use, and stability: a new resource division and isolation feature that allows users to divide BE nodes in a cluster into resource groups by means of resource tags, enabling unified management of online and offline services and resource isolation; the addition of Runtime Filter and Join Reorder functions have been added to significantly improve the query efficiency of multi-table Join scenarios, with a 2-10 times performance improvement under the Star Schema Benchmark test data set; new import method Binlog Load enables Doris to incrementally synchronize the CDC of data update operations in MySQL; support for String column type The new import method, Binlog Load, allows Doris to incrementally synchronize the CDC of MySQL for data update operations; supports String column type with a maximum length of 2GB; supports List partitioning to create partitions by enumerating values; supports Update statements on the Unique Key model; Spark-Doris-Connector supports data writing to Doris ... ...and many more important features, welcome to download and use.\\n\\nWe welcome you to contact us via GitHub Discussion or the Dev email group if you have any questions during use, and we look forward to your participation in community discussions and building.\\n\\n## High Lights\\n\\n### Resource Segregation and Isolation\\n\\nYou can divide BE nodes in a Doris cluster into resource groups by using resource tags, allowing you to manage online and offline operations and isolate resources at the node level.\\nYou can also control the resource overhead of individual queries by limiting the CPU and memory overhead and complexity of individual query tasks, thus reducing the resource hogging problem between different queries.\\n\\n### Performance Optimization\\n\\n* The Runtime Filter feature can significantly improve query efficiency in most Join scenarios by using the Join Key column condition of the right table in the Join algorithm to filter the data in the left table. For example, you can get 2-10 times performance improvement under Star Schema Benchmark (TPCH\'s streamlined test set).\\n\\n* The Join Reorder feature can automatically help adjust the order of joins in SQL by using a cost model to help achieve optimal join efficiency.\\nIt can be enabled via the session variable `set enable_cost_based_join_reorder=true`.\\n\\n### New features\\n\\n* Support synchronizing MySQL binlog data directly to Canal Server.\\n* Support String column type, support up to 2GB.\\n* Support List partitioning, you can create partitions for enumerated values.\\n* Support transactional Insert statement function. You can import data in bulk by begin ; insert ; insert;, ... You can import data in bulk by begin ; insert ; insert ;, ... ;.\\n* Support Update statement function on Unique Key model. You can execute Update Set where statement on Unique Key model table.\\n* Support SQL blocking list function. You can block some SQL execution by regular, hash value matching, etc.\\n* Support LDAP login authentication.\\n\\n### Extended Features\\n\\n* Support Flink-Doris-Connector.\\n* Support for DataX doriswriter plugin.\\n* Spark-Doris-Connector support for data writing to Doris.\\n\\n## Feature Optimization \\n\\n### Query\\n\\n* Support for computing all constant expressions in the SQL query planning phase using BE\'s functional computing power.\\n\\n### Import\\n\\n* Support for specifying multi-byte row separators or invisible separators when importing text format files.\\n* Supports importing compressed format files via Stream Load.\\n* Stream Load supports importing Json data in multi-line format.\\n\\n### Export\\n\\n* Support Export export function to specify where filter. Supports exporting files with multi-byte row separators. Support export to local files.\\n* Export export function supports exporting only specified columns.\\n* Supports exporting the result set to local disk via outfile statement and writing the exported marker file after exporting.\\n\\n### Ease of use\\n\\n* Dynamic partitioning function supports creating and keeping specified historical partitions, and supports automatic hot and cold data migration settings.\\n* Supports displaying queries, imported schedules and Profiles using a visual tree structure at the command line.\\n* Support to record and view Stream Load operation logs.\\n* When consuming Kafka data via Routine Load, you can specify the time point for consumption.\\n* Supports exporting Routine Load creation statements by show create routine load function.\\n* Support to start and stop all Routine Load jobs with one click by pause/resume all routine load command.\\n* Supports modifying the Broker List and Topic of Routine Load by alter routine load statement.\\n* Support create table as select function.\\n* Support modify column comments and table comments by alter table command.\\n* show tablet status to add table creation time and data update time.\\n* Support show data skew command to check the data volume distribution of a table to troubleshoot data skewing problems.\\n* Support show/clean trash command to check the disk occupation of BE file recycle bin and clear it actively.\\n* Support show view statement to show which views a table is referenced by.\\n\\n### New functions\\n\\n* `bitmap_min`, `bit_length`\\n* `yearweek`, `week`, `makedate`\\n* `percentile` exact percentile function\\n* `json_array`, `json_object`, `json_quote`\\n* Support for creating custom public keys for the `AES_ENCRYPT` and `AES_DECRYPT` functions.\\n* Support for creating function aliases to combine multiple functions by `create alias function`.\\n\\n### Other\\n\\n* Support for accessing the ES exterior of the SSL connection protocol.\\n* Support specifying the number of hotspot partitions in the dynamic partition property, which will be stored in SSD disks.\\n* Support importing Json format data via Broker Load.\\n* Supports accessing HDFS directly through libhdfs3 library for data import and export without the Broker process.\\n* select into outfile function supports exporting Parquet file format and parallel export.\\n* ODBC external table support for SQLServer. \\n\\n## \u81f4\u8c22  \\n\\nThe release of Apache Doris (incubating) 0.15.0 Release is made possible by the support of all community users.
